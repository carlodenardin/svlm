### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to perform a specific operation on a list of integers. It takes a list of integers as input, applies a set of rules to each element, and returns the modified list. The rules are designed to either increment or decrement each element based on certain conditions.

### Input Data

- **List of integers**: The input is a list of integers, denoted as `n`.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Start**: The process begins.
2. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
3. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
4. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
5. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
6. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
7. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
8. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
9. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
10. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
11. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
12. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
13. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
14. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
15. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size of the list `n`.
16. **Create a list of dimension n**: Initialize a list with `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
17. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives the size
