The flowchart represents an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, x and y. The algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.

The input data required for this algorithm is two integers, x and y.

The main logical flow of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Start: The algorithm begins with the input integers x and y.
2. n: Initialize a variable n with the value of the input integers x and y.
3. i: Initialize a variable i with the value 1.
4. While i is less than n:
   a. If i is less than or equal to n, set i to n and continue to the next iteration.
   b. If i is greater than n, set i to i-1 and continue to the next iteration.
   c. If i is equal to 1, set i to 1 and continue to the next iteration.
   d. If i is greater than 1, set i to i-1 and continue to the next iteration.
5. If i is equal to 1, set j to i and continue to the next iteration.
6. If j is less than i, set j to j+1 and continue to the next iteration.
7. If j is equal to i, set j to i and continue to the next iteration.
8. If j is greater than i, set j to j-1 and continue to the next iteration.
9. If j is equal to i+1, set j to i+1 and continue to the next iteration.
10. If j is greater than i+1, set j to j-1 and continue to the next iteration.
11. If j is equal to i+1, set j to i+1 and continue to the next iteration.
12. If j is greater than i+1, set j to j-1 and continue to the next iteration.
13. If j is equal to i+1, set j to i+1 and continue to the next iteration.
14. If j is greater than i+1, set j to j-1 and continue to the next iteration.
15. If j is equal to i+1, set j to i+1 and continue to the next iteration.
16. If j is greater than i+1, set j to j-1 and continue to the next iteration.
