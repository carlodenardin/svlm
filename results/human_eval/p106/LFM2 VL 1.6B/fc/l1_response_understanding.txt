Overview:
The algorithm is designed to find the product of numbers from 1 to n. It starts by initializing a result list and counter. It then checks if the input is less than n. If true, it calculates the product of numbers from 1 to n. If false, it adds the calculated value to the result list and increments the counter.

Input Data:
The input data required is an integer n.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize the result list and counter.
2. Check if n is less than the counter.
   - If true, calculate the product of numbers from 1 to n.
   - If false, add the calculated value to the result list and increment the counter.
3. Return the result list.

Expected Output:
The expected output is a list of numbers from 1 to n, where each number is the product of numbers from 1 to n.
