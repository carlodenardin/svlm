Overview:
The algorithm is designed to find the product of numbers from 1 to n. It takes an integer n as input and calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to n.

Input Data:
The input data required is an integer n.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize the result list and the counter.
2. If n is less than or equal to 1, the result is 1.
3. If n is greater than 1, calculate the product of numbers from 1 to n.
4. Add the calculated value to the result list and increment the counter.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until n reaches 1.
6. The expected output is the product of numbers from 1 to n.

Logical Flow Details:
- The algorithm starts by initializing the result list and the counter.
- If n is less than or equal to 1, the result is set to 1.
- If n is greater than 1, the algorithm calculates the product of numbers from 1 to n using a loop.
- Within the loop, the algorithm adds the calculated value to the result list and increments the counter.
- The loop continues until n reaches 1.
- The expected output is the product of numbers from 1 to n.

Function Calls:
- Initialize the result list and the counter: This function is called to initialize the result list and the counter.
- Calculate the product of numbers from 1 to n: This function is called within the loop to calculate the product of numbers from 1 to n.
- Add the calculated value to the result list and increment the counter: This function is called within the loop to add the calculated value to the result list and increment the counter.

Expected Output:
The expected output is the product of numbers from 1 to n.
