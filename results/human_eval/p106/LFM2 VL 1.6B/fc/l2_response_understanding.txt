Overview:
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of a sequence of integers. It starts with an initial value of n, then iteratively adds the value of i to the result until i reaches n. The final result is the sum of all values from 1 to n.

Input Data:
The algorithm requires an integer input, n, which represents the number of integers to be added.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start: The algorithm begins.
2. n: The initial value of n is set to the input integer.
3. i: A variable is initialized to 1.
4. While i <= n:
   a. Check if i is less than or equal to n.
   b. If true, add the value of i to the result.
   c. Increment i by 1.
5. If i is greater than n, the loop ends.
6. End: The algorithm ends.

Expected Output:
The algorithm calculates the sum of all values from 1 to n and returns the result.

Example:
If the input is 5, the algorithm will add 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to get a result of 15.
