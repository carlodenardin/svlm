## Algorithm: Generating a List of Dimensions

**Purpose:** This algorithm generates a list of dimensions, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until a specified number of dimensions (n) is reached.

**Input:**

* **n:** An integer representing the desired number of dimensions.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization:** The algorithm begins by initializing a list called `dimensions` to store the generated dimensions.

2. **Loop:** A `while` loop is used to iterate through the dimensions. The loop continues as long as the length of the `dimensions` list is less than `n`.

3. **Dimension Generation:** Inside the loop, a `for` loop is used to generate the next dimension. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and appends the current iteration value to the `dimensions` list.

4. **Output:** After the loop completes, the `dimensions` list is printed, displaying the generated list of dimensions.

**Expected Output:**

The output will be a list containing the generated dimensions, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until `n` dimensions are reached. For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Note:** The algorithm assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer.
