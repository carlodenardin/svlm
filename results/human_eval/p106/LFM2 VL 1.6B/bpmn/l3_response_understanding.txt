### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on a given initial value and a step size. It starts with an integer `n` and iteratively applies a transformation to generate the next number in the sequence. The transformation involves adding the current value of `x` to the previous value of `x` and incrementing `x` by 1. The process continues until the value of `x` exceeds `n`. The final output is the sequence of numbers generated up to the point where `x` is no longer less than `n`.

### Input Data

- **Initial Value (`n`)**: The starting integer value for the sequence.
- **Step Size (`j`)**: The increment value used in the transformation.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Initialize a List**: Create an empty list to store the sequence of numbers.
2. **Start Loop**: Begin a loop that continues until `x` is no longer less than `n`.
3. **Check Condition**: Inside the loop, check if `x` is less than `n`.
   - **If Yes**: If the condition is true, append `x` to the list and increment `x` by 1.
   - **If No**: If the condition is false, continue to the next step.
4. **Append to List**: Append the current value of `x` to the list.
5. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the list contains the sequence of numbers generated up to the point where `x` is no longer less than `n`.

### Expected Output

The output is a list of numbers generated by the transformation of the initial value `n` by the step size `j`. The sequence will stop when `x` exceeds `n`, and the list will contain all the numbers generated up to that point.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize a List**: Create an empty list `sequence`.
2. **Start Loop**: Use a `while` loop with the condition `x < n`.
3. **Check Condition**: Inside the loop, check if `x` is less than `n`.
   - **If True**: Append `x` to `sequence` and increment `x` by 1.
   - **If False**: Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
4. **Append to List**: After the loop, append
