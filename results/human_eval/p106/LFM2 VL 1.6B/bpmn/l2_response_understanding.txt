Overview:
The algorithm is designed to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It takes two integers as input and returns their GCD.

Input Data:
- Two integers, m and n, where m > n.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize a list of dimensions n and an integer i that equals to 1.
2. Check if i is less than n. If yes, return the list.
3. If i is not less than n, compute the sum of i and append it to the list.
4. Check if the sum is divisible by i. If yes, compute the factorial of i and append it to the list.
5. Increment i by 1.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the sum is not divisible by i.
7. Return the list.

Expected Output:
The list containing the GCD of the two input integers.
