The flowchart represents an algorithm for generating a sequence based on the input integer `n`. Here's a step-by-step description of its implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins here.
2. **Input Data**: 
   - An integer `n` is required as input. This will determine the length and elements of the output sequence.
3. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the resulting sequence values.
   - Set an initial index variable `i` to 1.
4. **Loop Condition**:
   - Check if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. This determines whether the loop should continue executing.
5. **Decision Point**:
   - If `i <= n`, proceed with summing values from 1 to `i` and appending them to the `res` list.
   - If `i % 2 == 0`, multiply values from 1 to `i` and append them to the `res` list.
6. **Increment Index**:
   - Increment the value of `i` by 1 (`i = i + 1`) to move to the next iteration in the loop.
7. **Output**:
   - Once all iterations are complete, the final result stored in `res` is obtained.
8. **End**: The process concludes here.

**Expected Output**: The algorithm generates either a sum or a product sequence up to the specified number `n`. Depending on the condition checked within the loop, it outputs either the cumulative sums or products of integers from 1 to `n`.
