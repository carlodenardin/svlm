The flowchart represents an algorithm for generating a list of numbers based on certain conditions. Here's a detailed step-by-step description:

### Algorithm Overview:
The purpose of this algorithm is to generate and append values into a result variable (`res`) according to specific rules defined by the logic within the flowchart.

### Input Data:
- `n`: An integer representing the upper limit up to which the sequence will be generated.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: The process begins here.
2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set `res` as an empty list.
   - Initialize a counter variable `i` with a value of 1.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - Compare `i` with `n`.
     - If `i <= n` (YES): Proceed to sum values from 1 to `i`.
     - If `i > n` (NO): Append the current value of `res` to the end of `res` and terminate the loop.
4. **Sum Values**:
   - Sum all integers from 1 to `i`.
   - Append the resulting sum to the `res` list.
5. **Increment Counter**:
   - Increase the value of `i` by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
6. **Repeat**:
   - Return to the condition check at step 3 to continue processing until `i > n`.
7. **End**: Once all necessary computations are done, the process concludes.

### Expected Output:
The output will be a list (`res`) containing sums of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to but not including `n`. Each element in the list corresponds to the cumulative sum of its respective range.

This structured approach ensures that each part of the algorithm is clearly delineated, making it easy to implement and understand.
