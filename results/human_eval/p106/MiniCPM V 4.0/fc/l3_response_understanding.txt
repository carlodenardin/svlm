The flowchart describes an algorithm for generating a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Purpose**: The algorithm generates and stores a list containing the first n Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Input Data**: 
   - An integer `n` representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.
3. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the Fibonacci numbers.
   - Set the index variable `i` to 1 (starting from the second position).
4. **Main Loop**:
   - Enter a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
5. **Decision Making**:
   - Check if `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
     - If true, set `x` to 1 and increment `j` by 1.
     - If false, set `x` to 0 and increment `j` by 1.
6. **Fibonacci Calculation**:
   - If `j` equals `i`, calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers stored in `x` and append it to `res`.
   - Increment both `x` and `j`.
7. **Increment Index**:
   - Increment the value of `i` by 1.
8. **Output**:
   - Once the loop ends, return the list `res` containing the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

This process systematically calculates each subsequent Fibonacci number until the desired count is reached and collects them into the output list.
