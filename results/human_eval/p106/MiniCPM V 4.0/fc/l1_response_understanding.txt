The flowchart describes an algorithm designed to calculate a specific mathematical result based on the input integer \( n \). Here's a step-by-step implementation of the algorithm:

### Purpose
The purpose of this algorithm is to compute either the product or sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \), depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd.

### Input Data
- **Input**: An integer \( n \) representing the range up to which the calculation should be performed.

### Main Logical Flow
1. **Start**
2. **Input** the value of \( n \) as an integer.
3. **Initialize** two data structures: a list to store results and a counter for iteration.
4. **Check** if \( i \leq n \):
   - If true, proceed with further calculations based on whether \( i \) is even or odd:
     - **If \( i \) is even**, calculate the product of numbers from 1 to \( i \).
     - **Otherwise**, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to \( i \).
     - Add the calculated value to the result list and increment the counter.
   - If false, move directly to the output stage without performing any additional operations.
5. **Output** the final result obtained from the calculations stored in the result list.
6. **End** the process.

### Expected Output
- The expected output is the computed result (either the product or sum) of all integers from 1 to \( n \).

This structured approach ensures that the algorithm accurately processes the given input and produces the desired outcome efficiently.
