The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to calculate a specific mathematical result based on an integer input. Here's a step-by-step description of its implementation:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this algorithm is to compute either the product or sum of all integers from 1 to a given number \( n \), depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd.

### Input Data:
- **Input**: An integer \( n \) representing the upper limit for the range of numbers to be considered.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: The process begins here.
2. **Input n as Integer**: Take the user input for the value of \( n \).
3. **Initialize the Result List and Counter**: Create an empty list to store results and initialize a counter variable.
4. **Check Condition \( i < n \)**: Determine if the current iteration index \( i \) is less than \( n \).
   - If **YES**: Proceed to check if \( i \) is even.
     - **If i is Even**: Calculate the product of numbers from 1 to \( i \) using nested loops or a built-in function like `math.prod()` (Python).
     - **Otherwise**: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to \( i \) using another loop.
   - After performing the calculation, add the computed value to the result list and increment the counter.
   - Go back to checking condition \( i < n \).
   - If **NO**: Move directly to outputting the final result.
5. **Output Result**: Display the contents of the result list along with the total count of iterations performed.
6. **End**: The process concludes here.

### Expected Output:
The expected output will be two values separated by a newline character:
- The calculated result (either the product or sum of numbers up to \( n \)).
- The total number of elements processed during the computation.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in implementing the required calculations.
