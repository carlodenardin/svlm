The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to compute and return a list of numbers based on certain conditions. Here's a step-by-step description:

### Purpose:
The primary goal of this algorithm is to generate a list containing specific values depending on whether an integer \( n \) is even or odd, up to the value of \( n \).

### Input Data:
- An integer \( n \) as input.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: Begin with receiving an integer \( n \).
2. **Initialize List**: Initialize a list of dimension \( n \) and set the initial index \( i \) to 1.
3. **Loop Condition**: Check if \( i \leq n \).
   - If true, proceed to calculate the sum from 1 to \( i \) and append it to the list.
   - If false, exit the loop since all necessary computations have been completed.
4. **Check Even/Odd**: Determine if \( i \% 2 == 0 \) (i.e., check if \( i \) is even).
   - If true, compute the factorial of \( i \) and append it to the list.
   - If false, skip computing the factorial for even indices.
5. **Increment Index**: Increase the index \( i \) by 1 to move to the next iteration.
6. **Return Result**: Once the loop completes, return the generated list.

### Expected Output:
The output will be a list where each element represents either the cumulative sum from 1 to that index when \( i \) is odd, or the factorial of \( i \) when \( i \) is even. This list contains exactly \( n \) elements corresponding to the range [1, n].

This process ensures that both summation and factorial operations are applied correctly according to the parity of the index \( i \), producing the desired result efficiently.
