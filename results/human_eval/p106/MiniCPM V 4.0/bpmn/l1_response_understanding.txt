The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to compute and return a list of factorials for integers from 1 to n. Here's a step-by-step implementation based on the provided diagram:

### Purpose
The purpose of this algorithm is to generate a list where each element at index i contains the factorial of i, starting from 1 up to n.

### Input Data
- **n**: An integer representing the upper limit of the range for computing factorials.

### Main Logical Flow
1. **Start**: Begin with an empty list to store the factorials.
2. **Initialize Loop Counter**: Set a loop counter `i` to 1.
3. **Compute Factorials**:
   - For each value of `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - Compute the factorial of `i` using a nested loop or a recursive function if available.
     - Append the computed factorial to the list.
4. **End Loop**: Once all values have been processed (up to n), terminate the loop.
5. **Return Result**: Return the completed list containing factorials from 1 to n.

### Expected Output
- A list where each element at position i represents the factorial of i. The final output will be `[1!, 2!, 3!, ..., n!]`.

This process ensures that the desired list of factorials is accurately generated as per the input parameter n.
