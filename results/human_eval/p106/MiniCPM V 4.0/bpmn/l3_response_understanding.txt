The flowchart represents the generation of the Lucas's series, a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starting with 0 and 1. Here is a step-by-step implementation based on the algorithm depicted in the image:

### Purpose
The purpose of this algorithm is to generate the first n terms of Lucas's series.

### Input Data Required
- An integer \( n \) representing the number of terms to generate in the series.

### Main Logical Flow
1. **Receive an integer as \( n \)**: Start by taking input for \( n \), which determines how many terms of the series will be generated.
2. **Initialize a list of dimension \( n \) and an integer i equal to 1**: Create an empty list of size \( n \) and initialize a counter variable \( i \) to 1.
3. **Check if \( i \leq= n \)**: Determine whether the current iteration index \( i \) has reached or exceeded the desired length of the series.
   - If true, proceed to return the constructed list.
   - If false, continue processing further iterations.
4. **Decision Point: Check if \( i \% 2 == 0 \)**:
   - If true, set \( x \) to 1 and increment \( j \) by 1.
   - If false, set \( x \) to 0 and increment \( j \) by 1.
5. **Decision Point: Check if \( j <= i \)**:
   - If true, append \( x \) to the list and increase \( i \) by 1.
   - If false, repeat steps involving setting \( x \) and \( j \) accordingly before appending to the list.
6. **Loop Back**: Continue iterating through these decision points until all required terms are added to the list.
7. **Return the List**: Once the loop completes, return the populated list containing the Lucas's series up to the nth term.

### Expected Output
The output is a list where each element corresponds to a term in Lucas's series, specifically the first \( n \) elements calculated according to the defined logic within the flowchart.
