The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to generate a list of factorials or sums based on user input. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input from the user. This integer represents the dimension of the list that will be created.
2. **List Initialization**: A new list is initialized with one element, which is set to 1. This serves as the base for computing factorials starting from 1.
3. **Loop Execution**: The algorithm enters a loop where it iterates through values from 1 up to `n`. For each iteration `i`:
   - If `i` is even: Compute the factorial of `i` and append it to the list.
   - If `i` is odd: Compute the sum of all previously computed factorials (from 1 to `i-1`) and append it to the list.
4. **Output**: After completing the loop, the final list containing either the factorials of all numbers up to `n` or their cumulative sums is returned as output.

This structured approach ensures accurate computation and proper handling of both cases—factorials versus summations—depending on whether the index `i` is even or odd during the iterations.
