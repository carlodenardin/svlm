```python
def calculate_result(n):
    """
    Calculates a result based on the input integer n.

    The algorithm iterates from 1 to n.
    If the current number i is even, it calculates the product of numbers from 1 to i.
    Otherwise, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i.
    The calculated value is added to the result list and the counter is incremented.

    Args:
        n: An integer.

    Returns:
        A list containing the calculated values.
