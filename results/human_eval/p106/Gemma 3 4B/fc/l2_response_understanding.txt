Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This algorithm appears to be designed to perform two operations on a sequence of numbers from 1 to *n*, where *n* is an integer input. It calculates both the sum and the product of these numbers.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **n:** An integer representing the upper limit of the sequence (inclusive).  The algorithm will iterate from 1 to *n*.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `n` is an integer input.
    *   `res` is initialized as an empty list (or array) and `i` is initialized to 1.  This `res` variable will store the results of both the sum and product calculations.

2.  **Looping:** The `while` loop continues as long as `i <= n`.

3.  **Decision Point 1: `i % 2 == 0`**
    *   **If `i` is even:**  The algorithm multiplies the values from 1 to `i` and appends the result to the `res` variable.
    *   **If `i` is odd:** The algorithm sums the values from 1 to `i` and appends the sum to the `res` variable.

4.  **Increment `i`:** `i = i + 1`. This moves to the next number in the sequence.

5.  **Loop Termination:** When `i > n`, the `while` loop terminates.

6.  **Output:** The `res` variable now contains both the sum and the product of the numbers from 1 to *n*, interleaved based on whether the number was even or odd.

**4. Expected Output**

The `res` variable will be a list (or array) containing the sum and product values. The order of the elements in the list will be determined by the parity of the number being processed (even or odd).  Specifically:

*   `res[0]` will be the sum of odd numbers from 1 to *n*.
*   `res[1]` will be the product of odd numbers from 1 to *n*.
*   `res[2]` will be the sum of even numbers from 1 to *
