Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm calculates a list of values based on whether the input integer `n` is even or odd.  It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and, for each number `i`, calculates either the product of all numbers from 1 to `i` (if `i` is even) or the sum of all numbers from 1 to `i` (if `i` is odd). These calculated values are then stored in a result list.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`n`:** An integer representing the upper limit of the iteration.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input `n`:** The program prompts the user to enter an integer value, which is stored in the variable `n`.
3.  **Initialization:**
    *   A result list (e.g., an array or list) is created to store the calculated values.
    *   A counter variable is initialized to 0. This counter will track the number of values added to the result list.
4.  **Loop (Iteration):** The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
    *   **Check if `i` is even:** Inside the loop, the program checks if the current value of `i` is even.
        *   **If `i` is even:** Calculate the product of all integers from 1 to `i`.  This can be done using a simple loop or a mathematical formula (n! / 0! = n!).
        *   **Otherwise (if `i` is odd):** Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `i`. This can be done using the formula: n * (n + 1) / 2.
    *   **Store Calculated Value:** The calculated value (either the product or the sum) is added to the result list.
    *   **Increment Counter:** The counter variable is incremented by 1.
5.  **Loop Termination:** The loop continues until `i` becomes greater than `n`.
6.  **Output:** The algorithm outputs the result list.
7.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.
