Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to generate a list of numbers. It calculates two operations for each integer `n` from 1 to `n`: the sum of integers from 1 to `i` and the factorial of `i`.  The results of these calculations are appended to a list, which is then returned.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Integer `n`:** This is the primary input to the algorithm. It determines the upper limit of the loop and, consequently, the number of calculations performed.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty list (e.g., `result_list = []`).
    *   Initialize an integer variable `i` to 1.

2.  **Looping:**
    *   **Condition:**  While `i` is less than or equal to `n` (i.e., as long as `i` is within the specified range).
    *   **Inside the Loop:**
        *   **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `i` (using the formula `sum = i * (i + 1) / 2`). Append this sum to the `result_list`.
        *   **Factorial Calculation:** Calculate the factorial of `i` (i.e., `i! = i * (i-1) * (i-2) * ... * 1`). Append this factorial to the `result_list`.
        *   **Increment:** Increment `i` by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

3.  **Termination:**
    *   When the loop condition (`i <= n`) becomes false, the loop terminates.

4.  **Return:**
    *   Return the `result_list`, which now contains the sum and factorial for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a list where each element represents a pair of values:
*   The first element of each pair is the sum of integers from 1 to the corresponding index of the list.
*   The second element of each pair is the factorial of the corresponding index of the list.

**Example:**

If the input `n
