Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to create a list of dimension *n* where each element in the list is calculated based on whether the index *i* of that element is even or odd. If *i* is even, the element's value is the factorial of *i*. If *i* is odd, the element's value is the sum of integers from 1 to *i*.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Integer (n):** This is the primary input. It determines the dimension of the list to be created.  *n* must be a non-negative integer.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer *n* as input.
2.  **Create List:**  A list (or array) of dimension *n* is created.  This list will store the calculated values for each element.
3.  **Populate List (Loop):**  The algorithm iterates through the list, starting from index *i* = 1 up to *n*.
    *   **Check for Even/Odd:** For each index *i*, it checks if *i* is even or odd.
    *   **If Even:** If *i* is even, the factorial of *i* is calculated (using a factorial function – see below). The factorial is then assigned as the value of the element at index *i* in the list.
    *   **If Odd:** If *i* is odd, the sum of integers from 1 to *i* is calculated (using a sum function – see below). The sum is then assigned as the value of the element at index *i* in the list.
4.  **Return List:** After iterating through all the elements of the list, the algorithm returns the populated list.

**4. Helper Functions (Assumed)**

*   **Factorial Function:**  A function named `factorial(x)` is assumed to exist. This function takes an integer *x* as input and returns the factorial of *x* (x!).  For example, `factorial(5)` would return 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).
*   **Sum Function:** A function named `sum
