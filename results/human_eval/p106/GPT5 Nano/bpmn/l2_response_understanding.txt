Certainly! Here's a structured breakdown based on the flowchart:

---

### **Overview**
This algorithm generates a list of integers based on a user-provided input `n`. For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `i` is even, the factorial of `i` is computed and added to the list; if `i` is odd, the sum from 1 to `i` is computed and added to the list. The resulting list is then returned.

---

### **Input Data**
- An integer `n` (the size and upper limit for the computations).

---

### **Logical Flow**
1. **Input Reception**
   - Prompt the user (or receive) an integer value `n`.

2. **Initialization**
   - Create an empty list `result_list` of size `n`.
   - Set an integer counter `i = 1`.

3. **Main Loop**
   - **While** `i` less than or equal to `n`:
     1. **Even/Odd Decision**
        - **If** `i % 2 == 0` (i is even):
          - Compute `factorial(i)`.
          - Append the result to `result_list`.
        - **Else** (i is odd):
          - Compute the sum from 1 to `i` inclusive.
          - Append the result to `result_list`.
     2. Increment `i` by 1.

4. **Exit Condition**
   - When `i` exceeds `n`, exit the loop.

5. **Output**
   - Return the `result_list`.

---

### **Expected Output**
- A list of length `n`, where each element at index `i-1` (1-based `i`) is either:
  - The sum from 1 to `i` if `i` is odd.
  - The factorial of `i` if `i` is even.

---

### **Example**
For `n = 5`, the process is:
  - i = 1 (odd): sum 1 = **1**
  - i = 2 (even): factorial 2 = **2**
  - i = 3 (odd): sum 1+2+3 = **6**
  - i = 4 (even): factorial 4 = **24**
  - i = 5 (odd): sum 1+2+3+4+5 = **15**

**Output:** `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]`

---

### **Pseudo-code Example**
```python
def compute_list(n):
    result_list = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Compute factorial
            fact = 1
            for x in range(1, i+1):
                fact *= x
            result_list.append(fact)
        else:
            # Compute sum
            s = sum(range(1, i+1))
            result_list.append(s)
        i += 1
    return result_list
```
