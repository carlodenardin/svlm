Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm illustrated in the flowchart:

---

### 1. **Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

The algorithm generates a list containing `n` values based on a rule:  
- For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `i` is even, the `i`-th element is `i!` (factorial of `i`).  
- If `i` is odd, the `i`-th element is the sum of integers from 1 to `i`.

---

### 2. **Input Data Required**

- **n** (`integer`): The size of the list and the upper bound for iteration. It must be a positive integer.

---

### 3. **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Receive integer n**  
   - Validate `n` if necessary (optional).

2. **Create a list of dimension n**  
   - Initialize an empty list or an array to hold `n` elements.

3. **Loop from i = 1 to n:**  
   - For each `i` in this range:
     - **If i is even:**
       - Compute the factorial of `i` (`i!`).
       - Append the result to the list at position `i-1`.
     - **Else (i is odd):**
       - Compute the sum of all integers from 1 to `i` (i.e., sum = `1 + 2 + ... + i`).
       - Append the result to the list at position `i-1`.

4. **End loop when all values from 1 to n have been processed.**

---

### 4. **Expected Output**

- **A list (array) of size n:**  
  Where each element is determined as described above:
  - **Even index:** contains factorial of that number.
  - **Odd index:** contains sum from 1 to that number.

### **Sample Implementation Outline (Python-like Pseudocode)**

```python
def custom_sequence(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Compute factorial
            val = 1
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                val *= j
            result.append(val)
        else:
            # Compute sum 1 to i
            val = (i * (i + 1)) // 2
            result.append(val)
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 5
sequence = custom_sequence(n)
print(sequence)  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```
