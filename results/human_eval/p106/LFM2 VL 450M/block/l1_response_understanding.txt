The algorithm's purpose is to create a list of values from 1 to n, where n is the input number. The input data required is the number n. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start from i = 1 to i = n
2. Create a list of values from 1 to i
3. Return the list of values

The expected output is a list of values from 1 to n.
