The algorithm's purpose is to find the smallest integer that is divisible by all integers from 1 to n. The input data required is the integer n. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive an integer as n.
2. Initialize a list of dimensions and an integer i to 1.
3. Initialize a list of n-1 to 1.
4. Loop through the list of n-1 integers.
5. If the current integer i is divisible by all integers from 1 to n-1, append it to the list of n-1 integers.
6. Return the list of n-1 integers.
7. If the current integer i is not divisible by all integers from 1 to n-1, loop through the list of n-1 integers again.
8. If the current integer i is divisible by all integers from 1 to n-1, append it to the list of n-1 integers.
9. Return the list of n-1 integers.

The expected output is the smallest integer that is divisible by all integers from 1 to n.
