The algorithm's purpose is to find the maximum value in a list of numbers. The input data required is a list of numbers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable max to the first number in the list.
2. Iterate through the list of numbers starting from the second number.
3. For each number, check if it is greater than the current max.
4. If it is, update the max to the current number.
5. After iterating through the entire list, return the max value.

The expected output is the maximum value in the list.
