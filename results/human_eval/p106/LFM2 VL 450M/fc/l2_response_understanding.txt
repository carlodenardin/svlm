The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of two numbers, `n` and `i`, and return the result. The input data required is the two numbers `n` and `i`. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input `n` and `i` into the function `res`.
3. If `i` is less than or equal to 1, return `res`.
4. Otherwise, calculate `i` divided by `n` and add it to `res`.
5. If `i` is greater than 1, return `res`.
6. If `i` is 0, return `res`.
7. If `i` is 1, return `i`.
8. If `i` is greater than 2, return `res`.
9. If `i` is less than 2, return `res`.

The expected output is the sum of `n` and `i`, which is returned by the function.
