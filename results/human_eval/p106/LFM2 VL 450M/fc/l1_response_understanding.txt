The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of products of numbers from 1 to i, where i is the input integer. The input data required is the integer i. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input as integer
3. Initialize the result list and the counter
4. Initialize the result list
5. Initialize the counter
6. If i is even, calculate the product of numbers from 1 to i and add it to the result list
7. If i is odd, calculate the sum of products of numbers from 1 to i
8. Add the calculated value to the result list
9. Increment the counter
10. End

The expected output is the sum of products of numbers from 1 to i.
