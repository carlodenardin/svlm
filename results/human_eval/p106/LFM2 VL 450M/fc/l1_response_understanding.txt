The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of the product of numbers from 1 to i, where i is the counter. The input data required is the counter i. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input as integer
3. Initialize the result list and the counter i
4. Initialize the counter i
5. If i is even, calculate the product of numbers from 1 to i and add it to the result list
6. If i is odd, otherwise calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i
7. Add the calculated value to the result list
8. Increment the counter i
9. End

The expected output is the sum of the product of numbers from 1 to i.
