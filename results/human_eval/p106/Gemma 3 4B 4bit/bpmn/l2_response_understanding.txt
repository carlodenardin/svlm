Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm calculates a list containing two values for each integer `n` from 1 to `n`.  Specifically, it computes the sum from 1 to `n` and the factorial of `n`, and appends these two values to a list.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`n`**: An integer representing the upper limit of the sequence.  The algorithm will iterate from 1 to `n`.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Receive an integer `n` as input.
    *   Initialize an empty list (e.g., `result_list = []`).
    *   Initialize an integer `i` to 1. This `i` will be the loop counter.

2.  **Loop:**
    *   **Condition:**  `i <= n` (while `i` is less than or equal to `n`)
    *   **Inside the loop:**
        *   **Sum Calculation:** Compute the sum of integers from 1 to `i` (inclusive).  This can be done using a simple loop or a formula (e.g., `sum_to_i = sum(range(1, i + 1))`). Append this `sum_to_i` to the `result_list`.
        *   **Factorial Calculation:** Compute the factorial of `i`.  This can be done using a recursive or iterative approach.  The factorial of `i` is the product of all integers from 1 to `i` (e.g., `factorial_i = 1`). Append this `factorial_i` to the `result_list`.
        *   **Increment:** Increase `i` by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

3.  **Termination:**
    *   When the loop condition `i <= n` becomes false (i.e., `i` becomes greater than `n`), the loop terminates.

4.  **Output:**
    *   Return the `result_list`.  This list will contain pairs of values: (sum from 1 to `i`, factorial of `i`) for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a list
