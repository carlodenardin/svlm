Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This flowchart describes an algorithm that generates a list (or array) of numbers. Specifically, it appears to be generating a sequence of numbers, likely based on some iterative process.  The algorithm seems to be building a list where each element is either 0 or 1, and the number of elements in the list is equal to the input integer `n`.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **An integer `n`:** This is the primary input to the algorithm. It determines the size (number of elements) of the list that will be generated.  `n` must be a non-negative integer.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input.
2.  **Initialization:**
    *   A list (or array) of dimension `n` is initialized.  All elements in this list are initially set to 0.
    *   An integer variable `i` is initialized to 1. This variable will be used as a loop counter and index.
3.  **Outer Loop (while loop):** The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i <= n`.
4.  **Inner Loop (if-else statements):** Inside the outer loop, there are nested `if-else` statements:
    *   **Condition 1:** `if i <= n`:  If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the algorithm performs the following:
        *   `x` is initialized to 0 and `j` is initialized to 1.
        *   Another `while` loop (inner loop) runs as long as `j <= i`.
            *   Inside the inner loop:
                *   `x` is incremented by 1 (`x += 1`).
                *   `j` is incremented by 1 (`j += 1`).
            *   After the inner loop completes, the value of `x` is appended to the list, and `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).
    *   **Condition 2:** `else`: If `i` is greater than `n`, the algorithm performs the following:
        *
