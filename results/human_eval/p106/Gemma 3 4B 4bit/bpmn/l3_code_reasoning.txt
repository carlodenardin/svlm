```python
def generate_sequence(n):
    # Initialize a list of length n with zeros
    result = [0] * n
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        # Inner loop: compute x as the number of iterations (which equals i)
        x = 0
        j = 1
        while j <= i:
            x += 1
            j += 1
        # Append x to the list
        result.append(x)
        i += 1
        # The else branch described in the prompt is not reachable here
    return result
