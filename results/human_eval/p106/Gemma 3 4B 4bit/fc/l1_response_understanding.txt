Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to calculate a sequence of values based on the input integer `n`.  It iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and, for each number `i`, calculates either the product of numbers from 1 to `i` or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`, depending on whether `i` is even or odd.  The calculated value is then added to a result list.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`n`:** An integer representing the upper limit of the iteration.  The algorithm will iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input:** The algorithm prompts the user to enter an integer `n`.
3.  **Initialization:**
    *   A result list (likely an array or list) is created and initialized as empty.
    *   A counter variable is initialized to 0. This counter will track the number of values added to the result list.
4.  **Loop:** The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
5.  **Decision:** Inside the loop, a conditional statement checks if `i` is even.
    *   **If `i` is even:** The algorithm calculates the product of all integers from 1 to `i`.  This is typically done using a loop or a mathematical formula (e.g., `i * (i-1) * (i-2) ... 1`).
    *   **Otherwise (if `i` is odd):** The algorithm calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `i`.  This is typically done using a loop or a mathematical formula (e.g., `i + (i-1) + (i-2) ... 1`).
6.  **Calculation:** The calculated value (either product or sum) is determined based on the even/odd check.
7.  **Append:** The calculated value is added to the result list.
8.  **Increment:** The counter variable is incremented by 1.
9.  **Update `i`:** The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
