**Algorithm Overview**
=======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to compute the factorial of a given integer `n` by iteratively calculating the factorial of each integer from 1 to `n` and appending the results to a list.

### Input Data
* `n`: The input integer for which the factorial is to be computed.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Receive an integer as `n`
* The algorithm receives an integer `n` as input.

#### Step 2: Create a list of dimension `n`
* The algorithm creates a list of dimension `n` to store the factorial values.

#### Step 3: Compute the factorial of each integer from 1 to `n`
* The algorithm iterates from 1 to `n` and computes the factorial of each integer using a loop.

#### Step 4: Append the results to the list
* The algorithm appends the computed factorial values to the list.

#### Step 5: Return the list of factorials
* The algorithm returns the list of factorials as output.

### Expected Output
The algorithm returns a list of factorials of integers from 1 to `n`, where each factorial value is computed and appended to the list.

### Example Use Case
Suppose the input `n` is 5. The algorithm will compute the factorials of integers from 1 to 5 and return the resulting list:

| Factorial | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 24 |
| 5 | 120 |

Note: The actual output may vary depending on the input value of `n`.
