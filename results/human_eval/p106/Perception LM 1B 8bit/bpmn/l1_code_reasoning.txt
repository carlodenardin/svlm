```python
def factorial_list(n):
    # Step 1: Receive an integer as n
    # Step 2: Create a list to store the factorial values
    result = []
    # Step 3 & 4: Compute factorial for each integer from 1 to n and append
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact = 1
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            fact *= j
        result.append(fact)
    # Step 5: Return the list of factorials
    return result
