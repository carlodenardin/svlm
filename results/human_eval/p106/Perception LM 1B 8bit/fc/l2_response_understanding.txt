**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of values from 1 to `i` and append them to a variable `res`. It also calculates the product of values from 1 to `i` and append them to `res`. The algorithm iterates through the range from 1 to `i`, performing the respective calculations and appending the results to `res`.

**Input Data:**
The input data required for this algorithm is an integer `i`.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with the variable `n` set to `int`, which represents the upper limit of the range from 1 to `i`.
2. **Res Calculation**: The algorithm calculates `res` by summing the values from 1 to `i` using the formula `res = []`, where `[]` represents an empty list. This step is performed once at the beginning of the algorithm.
3. **Loop**: The algorithm enters a loop that continues until `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Inside the loop, the algorithm checks if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. If true, it proceeds to the next step. If false, the algorithm ends the loop.
4. **Sum Calculation**: Inside the loop, the algorithm calculates the sum of values from 1 to `i` using the formula `i % 2 == 0`. This step is performed once within the loop.
5. **Product Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the product of values from 1 to `i` using the formula `i = i + 1`. This step is performed once within the loop.
6. **Res Update**: After the loop, the algorithm updates the `res` variable by appending the calculated sum and product to it.
7. **End**: The algorithm ends the process by returning the final value of `res`.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm calculates the sum of values from 1 to `i` and the product of values from 1 to `i`, and appends them to the `res` variable.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm can be implemented using a programming language such as Python or Java. The implementation would involve defining the input data, initializing variables, and performing the respective calculations and loops. The output would be the final value of `res`.
