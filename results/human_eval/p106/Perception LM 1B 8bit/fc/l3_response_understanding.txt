**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of all elements in a list of integers. It iterates through the list, performing arithmetic operations on each element to compute the sum.

**Input Data:**
The algorithm requires a list of integers as input. Each element is represented as an integer, and the list is assumed to be a sequence of integers.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with an empty list `res` and an index `i` set to 1.
2. **Loop**: The algorithm enters a loop that continues until the end of the list is reached.
3. **Arithmetic Operations**: Inside the loop, the algorithm performs the following operations:
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `n` (where `n` is the length of the list), the algorithm performs the following:
     - If `i` is not equal to 1, the algorithm adds `i` to `res` and increments `i` by 1.
     - If `i` is equal to 1, the algorithm sets `res` to an empty list `[]` and sets `i` to 1.
4. **Output**: After the loop completes, the algorithm returns the sum of all elements in the list, stored in `res`.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns the sum of all elements in the input list.

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_sum(input_list):
    res = []
    i = 1
    while i < len(input_list):
        if i <= len(input_list):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                res.append(input_list[i])
            else:
                res.append(input_list[i] + 1)
            i += 1
        else:
            res.append(0)
            i += 1
    return sum(res)

# Example usage:
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum(input_list)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's logic, using a loop to iterate through the input list and perform arithmetic operations to compute the sum.
