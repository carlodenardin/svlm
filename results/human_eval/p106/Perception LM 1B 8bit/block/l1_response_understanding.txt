**Algorithm Overview: Factorial Computation**
=============================================

**Purpose:** Compute the factorial of a given integer `n`.

**Input Data:**

* `n`: The input integer (a positive integer)

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive an integer as input (n)**: The algorithm receives a positive integer `n` as input.
2. **Create a list of dimension n**: The algorithm creates a list of `n` elements, each representing a power of `n`.
3. **Starting from i equal to 1 populate the list with these rules: if i is even compute the factorial of i, otherwise compute the sum of values from 1 to i**: The algorithm iterates from `i` to `n` and applies the following rules:
	* If `i` is even, the algorithm computes the factorial of `i`.
	* Otherwise, the algorithm computes the sum of values from 1 to `i`.
4. **Return the list**: The algorithm returns the list of `n` elements.

**Expected Output:**

The algorithm returns a list of `n` elements, where each element represents the factorial of its corresponding index `i`.

**Implementation:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    # Create a list of dimension n
    factorial_list = [1] * n
    
    # Iterate from i to n and apply the rules
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            factorial_list[i] = factorial_list[i-1] * i
        else:
            factorial_list[i] = sum(1 to i)
    
    return factorial_list
```
**Example Use Case:**
```python
n = 5
result = factorial(n)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
```
