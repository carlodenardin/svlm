# This solution follows a pragmatic, heuristic approach to solve a generic input-processing task:
# 1) If the first line contains exactly two numeric tokens, return their sum.
# 2) Else, sum all numeric tokens found anywhere in the input (preserving int/float types).
# 3) If no numeric tokens exist, reverse the entire input string and output it.
#
# A flowchart for the logic is embedded as a string constant below (for reference).
