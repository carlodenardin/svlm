I’m missing the “reasoning of a small VLM” you mentioned. Please provide:

- The problem statement or the exact reasoning steps you want me to translate.
- Any inputs/outputs, edge cases, and constraints.
- Format for the flowcharts (ASCII diagrams, or embedded as comments/strings, or images).
- Any specific Python version or library constraints.

Once I have the reasoning or problem details, I’ll produce the executable Python function exactly following it, and include:
- The code inside a Python code block.
- Flowchart diagrams for:
  - the entire code
  - the data structures used
  - the main window
  - the test cases

Please paste the reasoning text or the step-by-step approach you want me to implement.
