Certainly! Hereâ€™s how you can implement the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

---

## **Overview**
This algorithm takes a non-negative integer `n` as input, processes its digits to accumulate a sum, then repeatedly encodes that sum into a binary-like string in reverse order. Essentially, it appears to:
1. Compute the sum of all the decimal digits in `n`.
2. Convert that sum into its binary representation (in reverse).

---

### **Input Data**
- **Input:** A non-negative integer `n`.

---

### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Initialization**  
   - Set `sum = 0`  
   - Set `res = ""` (an empty string)

2. **First Loop:** Accumulate the digits of `n` into `sum`
   - While `n > 0`:
     - Add the least significant digit of `n` to `sum` (`sum += n % 10`)
     - Remove the least significant digit from `n` (`n = n // 10`)

3. **Second Loop:** Encode `sum` in binary, building representation in reverse
   - While `sum > 0`:
     - Compute the remainder when `sum` is divided by 2 (`r = sum % 2`)
     - Divide `sum` by 2 (`sum = sum // 2`)
     - Append the string value of `r` to `res` (`res += str(r)`)

4. **Return Output**
   - Return the variable `res`

---

### **Expected Output**
- **Output:** A string containing the reversed binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

---

## **Pseudocode Summary**

```python
def reversed_digit_sum_binary(n):
    sum = 0
    res = ""

    # Loop 1: Calculate the sum of digits
    while n > 0:
        sum += n % 10
        n = n // 10

    # Loop 2: Encode as reversed binary
    while sum > 0:
        r = sum % 2
        sum //= 2
        res += str(r)

    return res
```

---

**Example:**  
If `n = 123`  
Sum of digits = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6  
Binary of 6 = "110", but result returned is "011" (reversed).

---

**Implementation Interpretation:**  
- **This algorithm is useful when you need a quick, reversed binary string based on the sum of the decimal digits of a number.**
- **You can reverse `res` before returning to get the standard binary representation if needed.**
