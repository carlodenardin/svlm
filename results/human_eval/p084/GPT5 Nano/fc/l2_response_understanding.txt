Certainly! Based on the provided flowchart, here’s a ready-for-implementation description of the algorithm:

---

### **Overview**
This algorithm takes an integer as input, calculates the sum of its digits, and converts that sum into its binary representation as a string.

---

### **Input Data**
- **n:** An integer (the number whose digits will be summed).

---

### **Step-by-Step Logical Flow**

1. **Initialize Variables**
   - `sum = 0` (to store the sum of the digits)
   - `res = ""` (an empty string to store the binary representation)

2. **Calculate the Sum of Digits**
   - Extract each digit of the input `n` and add it to `sum`.
     - (This can be done using a loop: repeatedly get `n % 10` and `n // 10` until `n` becomes 0.)

3. **Convert to Binary**
   - Convert the integer value in `sum` into its binary equivalent (as a string).
     - (In most programming languages, you can use a built-in converter, e.g., Python’s `bin()` function and remove the `0b` prefix.)
   - Assign this binary string to the `res` variable.

---

### **Expected Output**
- **res:** A string containing the binary representation of the sum of the digits of `n`.

---

### **Pseudocode Example**

```python
n = input_integer
sum = 0

# Calculate sum of digits
temp = n
while temp > 0:
    sum += temp % 10
    temp //= 10

# Convert sum to binary string
res = bin(sum)[2:]

# Now res holds the desired output
print(res)
```

### **Summary Table**

| Step                         | Description                                              |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Input                        | Read integer `n`                                        |
| Initialize                   | `sum = 0`, `res = ""`                                   |
| Calculate sum of digits      | Loop over digits, add to `sum`                          |
| Convert to binary string     | Convert `sum` to binary, store in `res`                 |
| Output                       | Return or print `res`                                   |
