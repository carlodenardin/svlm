Okay, let's break down the algorithm described in the flowchart and outline its implementation.

**Overview:**

The algorithm aims to convert a non-negative integer into its binary representation as a string. It does this by repeatedly summing the digits of the integer until the result becomes a single digit.  This single-digit sum is then converted to its binary representation, which is finally returned as a string.

**Input Data:**

*   **Integer Input (n):** A non-negative integer.  The flowchart specifies `(0 <= n)`.  This means the input can be 0, 1, 2, 3, ... up to any non-negative integer.

**Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Receive Input:**  The algorithm begins by receiving the integer `n` as input.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize a variable `sum_digits` to 0.
    *   Initialize a variable `result` to an empty string.

3.  **Loop (Summing Digits):**
    *   While `n` is greater than 0:
        *   Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 ( `remainder = n % 10`).
        *   Add the `remainder` to `sum_digits` (`sum_digits = sum_digits + remainder`).
        *   Divide `n` by 10 (integer division) (`n = n // 10`).
        *   Append the `remainder` to the `result` string.

4.  **Final Summation:**
    *   After the loop completes, `sum_digits` will hold the sum of all the digits of the original integer.
    *   Calculate the sum of the digits in `sum_digits`.  This is done by summing the digits of `sum_digits` until a single digit remains.  This can be done with another loop or a simple iterative approach.

5.  **Binary Conversion:**
    *   Convert the final single-digit sum to its binary representation.  This can be done using the following logic:
        *   If the sum is 0, return "0".
        *   Otherwise, repeatedly divide the sum by 2 and store the remainder.  The remainders, read in reverse order, form the binary representation.

6.  **Return Result:**
