Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to convert a given integer (`n`) into its binary representation as a string. It achieves this by calculating the sum of the digits of the number and then converting that sum to its binary equivalent.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`n`:** An integer (whole number) representing the number to be converted.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `sum = 0` (Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will store the sum of the digits.)
    *   `res = ""` (Initialize an empty string `res`. This will store the final binary representation as a string.)

2.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   The algorithm iterates through the digits of the input number `n`.
    *   In each iteration:
        *   Extract the last digit of `n` (using the modulo operator `%`).
        *   Add the last digit to the `sum`.
        *   Remove the last digit from `n` (using integer division `//` or `div`).

3.  **Binary Conversion:**
    *   Convert the `sum` (which now holds the sum of the digits) to its binary representation. This is the core of the algorithm.  This can be done using the following steps:
        *   While the `sum` is greater than 0:
            *   Find the remainder when `sum` is divided by 2 (using the modulo operator `%`). This remainder will be either 0 or 1, representing a binary digit.
            *   Append this remainder to the `res` string.
            *   Divide `sum` by 2 (integer division) to remove the last digit.

4.  **Output:**
    *   Once the loop finishes (when `sum` becomes 0), the `res` string will contain the binary representation of the original number's digit sum.
    *   The algorithm returns the `res` string.

**4. Expected Output**

A string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

**Example:**

Let's say `n = 123`.

1.  `sum = 0`, `
