Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm aims to convert an integer `n` into its binary representation, but with a twist: it first sums the digits of the integer.  The result of this digit sum will then be converted to binary.  Essentially, it's a modified binary conversion where the digits of the original number are added before the final conversion.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`n`:** An integer (whole number) that will be the input to the algorithm.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input `n`:** The algorithm takes an integer `n` as input.
3.  **Sum Digits:**
    *   Initialize a variable `digit_sum` to 0.
    *   Iterate through each digit of `n`.  This can be done by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 and taking the remainder.  The remainder is the next digit.
    *   In each iteration, add the current digit to `digit_sum`.
4.  **Convert to Binary:**
    *   Convert the `digit_sum` to its binary representation. This can be done using a standard binary conversion function (e.g., a recursive function or an iterative approach).
5.  **Return Result:**
    *   Return the binary representation of the `digit_sum` as a string.
6.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a string representing the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

**Example:**

Let's say `n = 123`.

1.  `digit_sum` starts at 0.
2.  Loop:
    *   Digit 3: `digit_sum = 0 + 3 = 3`
    *   Digit 2: `digit_sum = 3 + 2 = 5`
    *   Digit 1: `digit_sum = 5 + 1 = 6`
3.  Convert 6 to binary: 6 in decimal is 110 in binary.
4.  Return "110".
