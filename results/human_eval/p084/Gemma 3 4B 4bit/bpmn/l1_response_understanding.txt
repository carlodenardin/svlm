Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**Overview:**

The algorithm aims to convert an integer into its binary representation, but with a twist: it sums the digits of the integer before converting to binary.  Essentially, it's calculating the sum of the digits of a number and then representing that sum in binary.

**Input Data:**

*   An integer number (let's call it `n`).

**Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input.

2.  **Calculate Digit Sum:**
    *   Initialize a variable `digit_sum` to 0.
    *   Enter a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   Extract the last digit of `n` (using the modulo operator `% 10`).
        *   Add this last digit to `digit_sum`.
        *   Integer divide `n` by 10 (using the floor division operator `//` or `// 10`). This effectively removes the last digit.
    *   The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

3.  **Convert Digit Sum to Binary:**
    *   Convert the `digit_sum` to its binary representation. This can be done using a standard binary conversion function or algorithm.  The function should return the binary representation as a string.

4.  **Output:**
    *   Return the binary string representation of the `digit_sum`.

**Example:**

Let's say the input `n` is 123.

1.  `digit_sum` is initialized to 0.
2.  Loop:
    *   Last digit: 3. `digit_sum` becomes 3. `n` becomes 12.
    *   Last digit: 2. `digit_sum` becomes 5. `n` becomes 1.
    *   Last digit: 1. `digit_sum` becomes 6. `n` becomes 0.
3.  The loop terminates.
4.  Convert 6 to binary: 6 in decimal is 110 in binary.
5.  The algorithm returns "110".
