Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to calculate a string representation of a number based on its digits. It essentially converts a number into a string by repeatedly adding the digit at the end to the result.  It continues this process until the number becomes less than or equal to 0.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer number `n`.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Set `sum = 0`.
    *   Set `res = ""`. (An empty string)

2.  **Loop:** The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3.  **Extract Last Digit:**
    *   Calculate the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator (`n % 10`). This digit is stored in the variable `r`.

4.  **Update Sum:**
    *   Add the last digit `r` to the `sum`: `sum += r`.

5.  **Update Number:**
    *   Integer division (`n // 10`) is used to remove the last digit from `n`.  This effectively shifts the number to the right.

6.  **Decision:**
    *   Check if `n` is greater than 0.
        *   If `n > 0`:  The loop continues to the next iteration.
        *   If `n <= 0`: The loop terminates.

7.  **String Manipulation:**
    *   `r = sum % 2`: Calculate the remainder when `sum` is divided by 2. This is likely intended to be the next digit to be added to the result.
    *   `sum //= 10`: Integer division of `sum` by 10 to remove the last digit of the sum.
    *   `res = str(r) + res`:  Append the digit `r` to the beginning of the `res` string.  (Note: the flowchart shows the string being built in reverse order, which is a common approach).

8.  **Output:**
    *   The algorithm returns the `res` variable, which contains the string representation of the original number `n`.
