Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to be designed to calculate the sum of the digits of an integer and then convert that sum into its binary representation.  It's essentially a digit-summing and binary-conversion process.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Integer Number:** The algorithm requires a single input: an integer number (presumably a positive integer).

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer number as input.
2.  **Initialization:** Two variables are initialized:
    *   `sum = 0`: This variable will store the sum of the digits.
    *   `res = ""`: This variable will store the binary representation of the sum.
3.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   The algorithm iterates through the digits of the input number.
    *   For each digit, it adds the digit's value to the `sum` variable.
4.  **Binary Conversion:**
    *   The algorithm converts the `sum` variable (which now holds the sum of the digits) into its binary representation. This likely involves a conversion function or a series of steps to represent the decimal sum in binary format.
5.  **Store Binary Result:** The binary representation of the sum is stored in the `res` variable.
6.  **Return Result:** Finally, the algorithm returns the value stored in the `res` variable, which is the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the original input number.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **String:** The algorithm is expected to return a string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer.  For example:
    *   If the input is 123, the expected output would be "1011". (1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and 6 in binary is 110).

**Implementation Notes & Considerations:**

*   **Binary Conversion Function:**  A crucial part of this algorithm is the binary conversion.  This will likely involve a function that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string.  Common approaches include repeated division by 2 and tracking the remainders.
*   **Error Handling:**  The algorithm doesn't appear to include
