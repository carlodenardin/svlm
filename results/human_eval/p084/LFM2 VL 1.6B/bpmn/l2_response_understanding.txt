### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. **Receive an integer number**: The algorithm starts by receiving an integer number from the user.
2. **Initialize two variables**: It initializes two variables, `sum` and `res`, to zero.
3. **Compute and allocate the sum**: The algorithm computes the sum of the digits of the integer number and allocates this sum to the variable `res`.
4. **Convert the sum to binary**: The algorithm converts the sum to binary representation.
5. **Save the binary sum in the res variable**: The binary sum is stored in the variable `res`.
6. **Return the variable res**: Finally, the algorithm returns the value stored in `res`.

### Input Data

- **Integer number**: The input to the algorithm is an integer number.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive the integer number**: The algorithm begins by receiving an integer number from the user.
2. **Initialize two variables**: It initializes two variables, `sum` and `res`, to zero.
3. **Compute and allocate the sum**: The algorithm computes the sum of the digits of the integer number and allocates this sum to the variable `res`.
4. **Convert the sum to binary**: The algorithm converts the sum to binary representation.
5. **Save the binary sum in the res variable**: The binary sum is stored in the variable `res`.
6. **Return the variable res**: Finally, the algorithm returns the value stored in `res`.

### Expected Output

- **Binary sum**: The algorithm returns the binary sum of the input integer number.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def receive_integer():
    # Receive the integer number from the user
    number = int(input("Enter an integer number: "))
    return number

def initialize_variables():
    # Initialize two variables, sum and res, to zero
    sum = 0
    res = 0

def compute_sum():
    # Compute the sum of the digits of the integer number
    while number > 0:
        digit = number % 10
        sum += digit
        number //= 10
    return sum

def convert_to_binary():
    # Convert the sum to binary representation
    binary = bin(sum
