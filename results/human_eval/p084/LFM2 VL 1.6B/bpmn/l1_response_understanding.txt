### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. **Input Data**: It requires an integer number as input.
2. **Processing**: It performs two main operations:
   - **Sum the digits of n**: This involves converting the integer to a string, iterating through each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers.
   - **Convert to binary**: It converts the summed integer to its binary representation.
3. **Output**: It returns the binary representation of the summed integer as a string.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive an integer number**: The algorithm starts by receiving an integer number from the user or an input source.
2. **Sum the digits of n**:
   - Convert the integer to a string.
   - Iterate over each character in the string.
   - Convert each character back to an integer.
   - Sum all these integers.
3. **Convert to binary**:
   - Convert the summed integer to its binary representation.
4. **Return the binary result**: The final step is to return the binary representation as a string.

### Expected Output

The output of the algorithm is a string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Input Handling**: Capture the integer number from the user or input source.
2. **String Conversion**: Convert the integer to a string.
3. **Digit Summation**: Iterate over each character in the string, convert it back to an integer, and sum these integers.
4. **Binary Conversion**: Convert the summed integer to its binary representation.
5. **Output**: Return the binary string as the final output.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
Input: integer n
1. Convert n to string
2. Initialize sum = 0
3. For each digit in the string:
   - Convert digit to integer
   - Add to sum
4. Convert sum to binary
5. Return binary string
```

### Conclusion

This algorithm efficiently processes the input integer, performs the required operations, and returns the binary representation as a string. It is a straightforward and effective solution for the given task.
