### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of a variable `n` and the result of a mathematical expression involving `n`. The expression is `sum = 0; n * res = n;`. The algorithm performs the following steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**: Set `sum` to 0 and `res` to the result of the expression `n * res = n`.
2. **Check Condition**: Determine if `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Calculate `n`**: If `n` is greater than 0, calculate `n` as `n * 2`.
4. **Update `res`**: If `n` is greater than 0, update `res` to `n`.
5. **Return Result**: Return the final value of `res`.

### Input Data

- **Input**: A variable `n` representing the number for which the sum and expression need to be calculated.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set `sum` to 0.
   - Set `res` to the result of `n * res = n`.

2. **Check Condition**:
   - If `n` is greater than 0, proceed to the next step.
   - If `n` is not greater than 0, return the value of `res`.

3. **Calculate `n`**:
   - If `n` is greater than 0, calculate `n` as `n * 2`.

4. **Update `res`**:
   - If `n` is greater than 0, update `res` to `n`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Return the final value of `res`.

### Expected Output

- The output is the final value of `res`, which is the result of the expression `sum = 0; n * res = n;` evaluated for the given value of `n`.

### Implementation

```plaintext
Receive an integer number n
Initialize two variables: sum = 0; res = n * res = n
n > 0
Calculate n = n * 2
If n > 0
    Update res = n
Return the final value of res
```

This algorithm efficiently calculates the sum of `n` and the result of the expression `n * res
