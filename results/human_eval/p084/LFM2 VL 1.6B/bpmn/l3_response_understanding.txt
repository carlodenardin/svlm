### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of a variable `n` and the result of a mathematical expression involving `n`. The expression is `sum = 0; n = n/10; res = str(n) + res`. The algorithm takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result of the expression.

### Input Data

- An integer `n`

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive an integer `n`**: The algorithm starts by receiving an integer `n` as input.

2. **Initialize two variables: sum = 0; res = ""**: The algorithm initializes two variables, `sum` and `res`, to 0 and an empty string, respectively.

3. **Check if `n` is greater than 0**: The algorithm checks if `n` is greater than 0.

4. **If `n` is greater than 0**:
   - **Calculate `sum`**: The algorithm calculates `sum` by adding `n` to itself `n/10` times.
   - **Update `res`**: The algorithm updates `res` by concatenating the string representation of `n` with the current value of `res`.
   - **Return `res`**: The algorithm returns the final value of `res`.

5. **If `n` is not greater than 0**:
   - **Return `res`**: The algorithm returns the final value of `res`.

### Expected Output

- The algorithm returns the result of the expression `sum = 0; n = n/10; res = str(n) + res`.

### Example

- If `n = 10`, the algorithm calculates `sum` as `10/10 = 1` and updates `res` as `"10"`.
- The algorithm returns `"10"`.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_sum(n):
    sum = 0
    res = ""
    if n > 0:
        sum = n + n/10
        res = str(n) + res
    return res
```

### Implementation

```python
def calculate_sum(n):
    sum = 0
    res = ""
    if n > 0:
        sum = n + n // 10
        res = str(n) + res
    return res
```
