### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to convert a given integer `n` into its binary representation. It takes an integer as input and outputs the binary string representation of that integer.

### Input Data Required

- An integer `n` (the number to be converted into binary).

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Start**: The process begins.
2. **Input n as integer**: The algorithm receives the integer `n` as input.
3. **Sum the digits of n and convert to binary**: The algorithm calculates the sum of the digits of `n` and converts this sum into its binary representation.
4. **Return result as string**: The algorithm outputs the binary string representation of `n`.

### Expected Output

- A binary string representing the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Start**: The process begins.
2. **Input n as integer**: The algorithm receives the integer `n` as input.
3. **Sum the digits of n and convert to binary**:
   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
   - Loop through each digit of `n` from right to left:
     - If the current digit is '1', add 1 to `sum`.
     - If the current digit is '0', add 0 to `sum`.
   - Convert the `sum` to binary string.
4. **Return result as string**: The algorithm outputs the binary string representation of `n`.

### Pseudocode

```
Start
  Input n as integer
  sum = 0
  for i = n-1 downto 0
    if digit(i) == '1'
      sum = sum + 1
    else
      sum = sum + 0
  binary = Convert sum to binary string
  Return binary
End
```

### Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently converts an integer into its binary representation by summing the digits and converting the result to binary. This process is straightforward and can be implemented in various programming languages.
