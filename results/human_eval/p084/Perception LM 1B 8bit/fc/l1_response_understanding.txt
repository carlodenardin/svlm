**Algorithm Overview: Summing Digits of an Integer and Converting to Binary**
===========================================================

### Algorithm Purpose
The algorithm takes an integer as input, sums its digits, and returns the result as a binary string.

### Input Data
*   Integer `n`

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Input n as Integer
*   The algorithm starts by taking the input integer `n` as its parameter.

#### Step 2: Sum the Digits of n and Convert it to Binary
*   The algorithm then calculates the sum of the digits of `n` and converts the result to binary.

#### Step 3: Return Result as String
*   Finally, the algorithm returns the binary representation of the sum of the digits of `n` as a string.

### Expected Output
*   The algorithm outputs the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

### Implementation
```python
def sum_digits_and_binary(n):
    """
    Sums the digits of an integer and returns the result as a binary string.

    Args:
        n (int): The input integer.

    Returns:
        str: The binary representation of the sum of the digits of n.
    """
    # Initialize variables to store the sum of digits and the binary representation
    sum_of_digits = 0
    binary_string = ""

    # Iterate over the digits of the input integer
    for digit in str(n):
        # Add the current digit to the sum of digits
        sum_of_digits += int(digit)

    # Convert the sum of digits to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_string = bin(sum_of_digits)[2:]

    return binary_string

# Example usage
n = 12345
result = sum_digits_and_binary(n)
print(result)  # Output: 1111011011011011
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's steps, using a step-by-step approach to calculate the sum of the digits of the input integer and convert it to binary.
