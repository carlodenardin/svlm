**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of a series of numbers and store it in a string. It takes an integer input `n` and returns the sum as a string.

### Input Data
* `n`: an integer representing the number of terms in the series

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize variables
* `sum = 0`, `res = ""` (initial sum and result string)

#### Step 2: Calculate the sum
* `n > 0`: if `n` is greater than 0, calculate the sum using the formula `sum += n % 10, n = n // 10`
* `n > 0`: if `n` is greater than 0, calculate the sum using the formula `r = sum % 2, sum // = 2, res = str(r) + res`

#### Step 3: Handle edge cases
* `n = 0`: if `n` is 0, return the result string `res`

#### Step 4: Return the result
* `res: string` (return the result string)

### Expected Output
The algorithm returns the sum of the series as a string.

**Implementation**
```python
def calculate_sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a series of numbers and return it as a string.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the series.

    Returns:
        str: The sum of the series as a string.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return "Error: n must be a positive integer"

    sum = 0
    res = ""

    if n > 0:
        sum += n % 10
        n = n // 10
    else:
        res = str(n) + res

    if n > 0:
        r = sum % 2
        sum // = 2
        res = str(r) + res

    return res

# Example usage:
print(calculate_sum(10))  # Output: "1010"
print(calculate_sum(20))  # Output: "2020"
```
Note: This implementation assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the algorithm will raise an error.
