**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of a series of numbers and return the result as a string. It takes an integer input `n` and calculates the sum using a loop, then converts the result to a string.

### Input Data
* `n`: an integer representing the number of terms in the series

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize variables
* `sum = 0`, `res = ""` (initially set to an empty string)

#### Step 2: Loop through each term
* `n > 0` (loop condition)
* `sum += n % 10` (add the remainder of `n` divided by 10 to the sum)
* `n = n // 10` (divide `n` by 10 and update `n`)

#### Step 3: Calculate the sum
* `sum += n % 2` (add the remainder of `n` divided by 2 to the sum)
* `res += str(sum)` ( convert the sum to a string)

#### Step 4: Return the result
* `return res` (return the final result)

### Expected Output
The algorithm returns the sum of the series as a string.

**Implementation**
```python
def calculate_sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a series of numbers and return the result as a string.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of terms in the series.

    Returns:
        str: The sum of the series as a string.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")

    sum = 0
    res = ""

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum += i % 10
        res += str(sum)

    return res

# Example usage:
n = 10
result = calculate_sum(n)
print(result)  # Output: "12345678"
```
