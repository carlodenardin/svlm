**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the remainder of a division operation, specifically to find the remainder of `n` divided by `10` and then calculate the remainder of the result divided by `2`. The process involves several steps to determine the final remainder.

**Input Data:**
- The input data required is an integer `n`.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm initializes two variables: `sum` to 0 and `res` to an empty string.

2. **Decision to Calculate Remainder**: The algorithm checks if `n` is greater than 0. If true, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and updates `res` with the remainder. If false, it returns `res` as is.

3. **Decision to Calculate Second Remainder**: After calculating the first remainder, the algorithm checks if the result is greater than 0. If true, it calculates the remainder of the first remainder divided by 2 and updates `res` with the remainder. If false, it returns `res` as is.

4. **Return the Result**: The final remainder is calculated and returned.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then the remainder of the result divided by 2.

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculateRemainder(n):
    # Initialize variables
    sum = 0
    res = ""

    # Calculate the first remainder
    if n > 0:
        remainder = n % 10
        res += str(remainder)
        n = n // 10

    # Calculate the second remainder
    if n > 0:
        remainder = n % 2
        res += str(remainder)
        n = n // 2

    # Return the final remainder
    return res

# Example usage
n = 17
result = calculateRemainder(n)
print(result)  # Output: "1 7"
```
