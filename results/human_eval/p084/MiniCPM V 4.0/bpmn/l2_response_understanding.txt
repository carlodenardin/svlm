The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to compute the sum of digits of a given integer and then convert that sum into binary format. Here is a step-by-step implementation description:

1. **Receive an Integer Number**: The process begins by accepting an integer input from the user or system.

2. **Initialize Two Variables**: Set up two variables, `sum` initialized to 0 and `res` initially set to an empty string (""). These will be used for accumulating the digit sum and storing the resulting binary representation respectively.

3. **Compute and Allocate in the Sum Variable**: Iterate through each digit of the received integer number. For each iteration:
   - Extract the last digit using modulo operation (`number % 10`).
   - Add this digit to the `sum` variable.
   - Remove the last digit from the original number by performing integer division (`number // 10`).

4. **Convert the Sum to Binary**: Once all digits have been processed and their sums recorded, convert the accumulated value of `sum` into its binary form. This can typically be done using built-in functions like `bin()` in many programming languages which converts an integer to a binary string prefixed with '0b'. Store this binary result in the `res` variable.

5. **Return the Res Variable**: Finally, return the `res` variable containing the binary representation of the sum of the input integerâ€™s digits.

This straightforward approach ensures accurate computation and conversion as required by the task specified in the flowchart.
