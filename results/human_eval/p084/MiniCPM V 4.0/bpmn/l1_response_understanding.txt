The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to convert an integer into its binary representation. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: The algorithm requires an integer number as input. This is the starting point of the process.
2. **Sum the digits of n and convert it to binary**: 
   - Begin by iterating through each digit of the given integer.
   - Sum these digits together.
   - Convert this summed total back into its binary form, where each digit represents either '0' or '1'.
3. **Give back the binary result as string**: 
   - Once converted from decimal to binary, store the resulting binary sequence in a string format for output.
4. **End**: 
   - The final output will be the binary representation of the original integer provided as a string.

This straightforward approach ensures that any integer can be systematically transformed into its binary equivalent using fundamental arithmetic operations and conditional logic.
