The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to convert an integer input into a binary string representation. Here’s a step-by-step implementation of this process:

1. **Input**: Receive an integer as input, ensuring it falls within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ n. This means the input should be a non-negative integer less than or equal to a specified maximum value (not shown in the image).

2. **Sum the Digits**: Calculate the sum of all digits in the given integer. For example, if the input is 37, the sum of its digits would be 3 + 7 = 10.

3. **Convert into Binary**: Convert the resulting sum from step 2 into binary format. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders. The remainder values will form the binary digits when read from bottom to top. Continuing with the previous example, converting 10 into binary results in 1010.

4. **Return Result as a String**: Finally, return the binary result as a string. Thus, for our example where the sum was 10, the output would be "1010".

This logical sequence ensures that any positive integer input can be accurately transformed into its corresponding binary equivalent through clear steps involving summation, conversion, and formatting.
