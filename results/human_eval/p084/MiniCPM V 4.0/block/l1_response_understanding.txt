The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to convert an integer input into a binary string representation. Here’s a detailed step-by-step process for implementing this algorithm:

1. **Receive an integer as input (0 ≤= n):**
   - The algorithm starts by accepting an integer \( n \) from the user or another source, ensuring that it falls within the range of 0 to \( n \) inclusive.

2. **Sum the digits:**
   - Convert the integer \( n \) into its individual digits and sum them up. For example, if \( n = 45 \), the digit sum would be \( 4 + 5 = 9 \).

3. **Convert it into binary:**
   - Use the calculated sum obtained in the previous step to determine the corresponding binary value. This involves converting the sum back into a binary format using standard bit manipulation techniques.

4. **Return result as a string:**
   - Finally, return the binary representation as a string. Ensure that any leading zeros are included to maintain consistency with binary notation.

This straightforward approach ensures that the given integer is accurately transformed into a binary string output.
