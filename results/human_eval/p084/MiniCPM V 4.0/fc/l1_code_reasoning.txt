```python
def int_to_binary(n: int) -> str:
    # Step 2: Input n as integer (already provided as parameter)
    if n == 0:
        return "0"

    # Handle negative numbers by converting the absolute value and prefixing '-'
    negative = n < 0
    if negative:
        n = -n

    # Step 3: Sum the digits of n and convert it to binary
    # Initialize an empty string to hold the binary result
    binary = ""
    while n > 0:
        remainder = n % 2
        # Append the remainder to the binary string
        binary += str(remainder)
        # Update n with the quotient
        n = n // 2

    # Since remainders are collected in reverse order, reverse the string
    binary = binary[::-1]

    # Step 4: Return result as string (with sign if negative)
    return ('-' + binary) if negative else binary
