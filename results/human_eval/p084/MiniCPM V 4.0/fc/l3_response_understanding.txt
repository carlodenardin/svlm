The flowchart outlines an algorithm that converts an integer `n` into a string representation of its remainder when divided by 10 repeatedly until the quotient is zero. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step description:

### Algorithm Overview:
The purpose of this algorithm is to convert an integer input (`n`) into a string format representing its last digit repeated for all digits from the most significant to the least significant.

### Input Data:
- **Input**: An integer `n`.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set `sum` to 0.
   - Initialize an empty string `res` with three double quotes ("").

2. **Check if n > 0**:
   - If `n` is greater than 0, proceed to the next steps.
   - Otherwise, move directly to the final output stage and end the process.

3. **Loop Until n becomes 0**:
   - Calculate the sum of the last digit of `n` using modulo operation (`n % 10`).
   - Append the calculated sum to `res`.
   - Update `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`).

4. **Check if sum > 0**:
   - If `sum` is still greater than 0 after the loop, continue appending it to `res`.
   - Otherwise, set `res` as the current value of `res` before exiting the function or method.

5. **Output Result**:
   - The variable `res` now contains the desired string representation of the original number's last digit repeated throughout all digits.

6. **End Process**:
   - End the execution of the algorithm.

### Expected Output:
The expected output is a string where each character in the result represents the last digit of the input number `n`, repeated across all positions. For example, if the input is 1234, the output will be "4444" because 4 is the last digit of 1234.

This concise implementation efficiently handles converting any given integer into a formatted string based on its trailing digits.
