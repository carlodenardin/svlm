The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to convert a given integer `n` into its corresponding string representation of prime factors. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process for implementation:

1. **Input**: The algorithm requires an integer input, denoted as `n`.
2. **Initialization**: 
   - Set the sum variable to 0.
   - Initialize an empty string `res` to store the result.
3. **Check if n is greater than 0**:
   - If `n > 0`, proceed with the following steps:
     - Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (`sum += n % 10`).
     - Update `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n = n // 10`).
4. **Loop until n becomes 0**:
   - Continue this loop while `n` remains greater than 0.
5. **Check if the current value of sum exceeds 0**:
   - If `sum > 0`, perform the next operations:
     - Calculate the quotient and remainder of `sum` divided by 2 (`r = sum % 2`, `sum //= 2`).
     - Append the character representing the residue (either '2' or '5') to `res` using `str(r)`.
6. **Output**: After processing all necessary steps, return the concatenated string `res` which represents the prime factorization of the original number `n`.
7. **End**: The algorithm concludes here once the desired output is obtained.

This algorithm effectively decomposes the input integer into its prime factors and converts these factors into a readable string format.
