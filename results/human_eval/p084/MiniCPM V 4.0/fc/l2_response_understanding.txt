The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer and convert that sum into binary format. Here's a detailed step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins here, indicating the initiation of the algorithm.
2. **Input Data**: 
   - An integer `n` is required as input. This represents the number whose digit sums will be calculated.
3. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set the variable `sum` to 0.
   - Initialize an empty string for storing the result in `res`.
4. **Calculate Digit Sum**:
   - Use a loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n`.
   - Within the loop, extract each digit by using modulo operation (`n % 10`).
   - Add each extracted digit to `sum`.
   - Remove the last digit from `n` using integer division (`n //= 10`).
5. **Convert Sum to Binary**:
   - Convert the accumulated `sum` value into its binary representation.
   - Store this binary representation in the `res` variable.
6. **Output Result**:
   - Output the resulting binary string stored in `res`.
7. **End**: The process concludes here, marking the termination of the algorithm execution.

This algorithm efficiently computes the sum of the digits of a number and converts that sum into binary form, providing a clear and structured solution suitable for software implementation.
