The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to convert a given integer into its binary representation. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the 'Start' node.
2. **Input n as integer**: The first action is to take an integer input, denoted as `n`.
3. **Sum the digits of n and convert it to binary**: 
   - Initialize a variable to store the sum of the digits.
   - Use a loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n`.
   - Within the loop, extract each digit by performing modulo operations (`n % 10`).
   - Add each extracted digit to the running total.
   - Update the value of `n` using integer division (`n // 10`) to remove the last processed digit.
4. **Return result as string**: After summing all the digits, convert the accumulated sum back into a binary string format.
5. **End**: The process concludes here.

This algorithm efficiently transforms any integer into its corresponding binary form by systematically processing each digit and converting them accordingly.
