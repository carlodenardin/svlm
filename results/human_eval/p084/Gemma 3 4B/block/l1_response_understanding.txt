Okay, let's break down this flowchart algorithm and outline its implementation.

**Overview:**

The algorithm's purpose is to take an integer as input, calculate the sum of its digits, convert that sum into its binary representation, and then return the binary string as the output.  Essentially, it's a series of transformations applied to the input number.

**Input Data:**

*   **Integer (n):** The algorithm requires a single integer input, denoted as 'n'. The flowchart specifies that `0 <= n` (n is a non-negative integer).

**Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the integer 'n' as input.

2.  **Sum Digits:**
    *   Initialize a variable `sum_of_digits` to 0.
    *   Use a `while` loop to iterate through the digits of 'n'.  Inside the loop:
        *   Calculate the remainder when 'n' is divided by 10. This gives the last digit.
        *   Add the last digit to `sum_of_digits`.
        *   Integer divide 'n' by 10 ( `n = n / 10`). This removes the last digit from 'n'.
    *   The loop continues until 'n' becomes 0.

3.  **Convert to Binary:**
    *   Convert the `sum_of_digits` (which is now the sum of the original number's digits) into its binary representation.  This can be done using a function or a built-in function (e.g., `bin()` in Python).
    *   The binary representation will be a string.

4.  **Return Result:** The algorithm returns the binary string as the final output.

**Expected Output:**

The algorithm will return a string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer 'n'.

**Example:**

Let's say the input `n = 123`.

1.  **Sum Digits:**
    *   `sum_of_digits` starts at 0.
    *   Loop iterations:
        *   Digit 3: `sum_of_digits = 0 + 3 = 3`
        *   Digit 2: `sum_of_digits = 3 + 2
