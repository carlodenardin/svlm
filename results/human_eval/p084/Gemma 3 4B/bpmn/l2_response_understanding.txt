Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of the digits of an integer and then convert that sum into its binary representation. The result (the binary representation of the sum) is then returned.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer number (let's call it `num`).

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Integer:** The algorithm starts by receiving an integer number (`num`) as input.
2.  **Initialization:** Two variables are initialized:
    *   `sum` is set to 0. This variable will store the sum of the digits.
    *   `res` is initialized to an empty string. This variable will store the binary representation of the sum.
3.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   The algorithm iterates through the digits of the input number `num`.  This is implicitly done by repeatedly taking the remainder when `num` is divided by 10 (which gives the last digit) and then dividing `num` by 10 to remove the last digit.
    *   In each iteration, the last digit is added to the `sum` variable.
4.  **Binary Conversion:**
    *   The `sum` variable (which now holds the sum of the digits) is converted to its binary representation.  This can be done using a standard binary conversion function or algorithm.
5.  **Store Binary Representation:** The binary representation of the `sum` is stored in the `res` variable.
6.  **Return Result:** The algorithm returns the value of the `res` variable, which contains the binary representation of the sum of the digits.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** A string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer.

**Example:**

Let's say the input `num` is 1234.

1.  `sum` = 0
2.  `res` = ""
3.  Digit Sum Calculation:
    *   Last digit: 4, `sum` = 4
    *   Last digit: 3, `sum` = 7
    *   Last digit: 2, `sum` = 9
    *   Last digit
