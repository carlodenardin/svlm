Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to take an integer as input, calculate the sum of its digits, and then convert that sum into its binary representation. Finally, it returns the binary representation as a string.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer number (let's call it `n`).

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Integer Number:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input.
2.  **Calculate Sum of Digits:**
    *   Initialize a variable `sum_of_digits` to 0.
    *   Use a loop (e.g., a `while` loop or a `for` loop) to iterate through the digits of `n`.  Inside the loop:
        *   Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. This gives you the last digit.
        *   Add this last digit to `sum_of_digits`.
        *   Integer divide `n` by 10 ( `n = n / 10`). This removes the last digit from `n`.
    *   The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
3.  **Convert Sum to Binary:**
    *   Convert the `sum_of_digits` to its binary representation. This can be done using a built-in function (e.g., `bin()` in Python, `toBinary()` in Java, etc.). The function will return a string representing the binary number (e.g., "1010").
4.  **Return Binary Result as String:** Return the binary string obtained in the previous step.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** A string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

**Example:**

Let's say the input `n` is 123.

1.  `sum_of_digits` starts at 0.
2.  Loop:
    *   Digit 3: `sum_of_digits` becomes 0 + 3 = 3. `n` becomes 12.
    *   Digit 2: `sum_of_digits` becomes 3 + 2 = 5
