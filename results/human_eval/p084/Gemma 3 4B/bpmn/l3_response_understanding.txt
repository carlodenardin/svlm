Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

The algorithm appears to be designed to calculate a result based on an integer input `n`. It involves summing digits of `n`, checking if the sum is greater than 0, and then performing some operations based on that condition.  The final result is stored in a variable called `res`.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **Integer `n`:** The algorithm takes a single integer as input. This is the number that will be processed.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input.
2.  **Initialization:** Two variables are initialized:
    *   `sum = 0`: This variable will store the sum of the digits of `n`.
    *   `res = ""`: This variable will store the final result. It's initialized as an empty string.
3.  **Looping Condition:** The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
4.  **Digit Sum Calculation:** Inside the loop:
    *   `sum += n % 10`: The last digit of `n` (obtained using the modulo operator `%`) is added to the `sum`.
    *   `n = n // 10`: The last digit is removed from `n` (integer division `//` is used to discard the remainder).
5.  **Conditional Check:** After the loop finishes (when `n` becomes 0), the algorithm checks if `sum` is greater than 0.
    *   **If `sum > 0`:**
        *   `r = sum % 2`: The remainder when `sum` is divided by 2 is calculated.
        *   `sum = sum // 10`: The sum is divided by 10 (integer division).
        *   `res = str(r) + res`: The value of `r` is converted to a string and concatenated to the beginning of the `res` variable.
    *   **If `sum <= 0`:** The algorithm returns the `res` variable.
6.  **Return Result:** The algorithm returns the final value stored in the `res` variable
