Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

The algorithm appears to be designed to take an integer input `n`, calculate a sum based on its value, and then convert the sum into a string representation. It also incorporates a modulo operation and a conditional check based on the sum's sign.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **`n`:** An integer input value.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `sum = 0` : Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will accumulate the sum of the input `n`.
    *   `res = ""`: Initialize an empty string variable `res`. This variable will store the final string representation of the sum.

2.  **Looping Condition:**
    *   `while (n > 0)`:  The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues as long as the value of `n` is greater than 0.

3.  **Inside the Loop:**
    *   `sum += n % 10`:  Calculate the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`) and add it to the `sum`. This effectively extracts the last digit of `n`.
    *   `n = n // 10`:  Integer division of `n` by 10 (`n // 10`). This removes the last digit from `n`.

4.  **Conditional Checks (Inside the Loop):**
    *   `if (sum > 0)`:  Check if the `sum` is greater than 0.
        *   `if (sum % 2 == 0)`: If the sum is even, calculate `r = sum // 2` (integer division by 2) and `sum = r`.
        *   `res += str(r)`: Append the string representation of `r` to the `res` string.
    *   `else`: If the `sum` is not greater than 0 (i.e., it's 0 or negative).
        *   `res = string`: Assign the string "res" to the variable `res`.

5.  **Loop Termination:**
    *   The `while` loop continues
