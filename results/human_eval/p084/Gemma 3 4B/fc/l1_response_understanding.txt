Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to take an integer as input, calculate the sum of its digits, convert that sum to its binary representation, and then return the binary representation as a string.  Essentially, it's a digit-sum-to-binary conversion process.

**2. Input Data**

*   **n:** An integer. This is the primary input to the algorithm.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input n:** The algorithm prompts the user to enter an integer value, which is stored in the variable `n`.
3.  **Sum Digits and Convert to Binary:**
    *   Initialize a variable `sum_of_digits` to 0.
    *   Use a `while` loop to iterate through each digit of the integer `n`.
        *   Inside the loop:
            *   Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. This gives the last digit.
            *   Add the last digit to `sum_of_digits`.
            *   Integer divide `n` by 10 (remove the last digit).
    *   Convert `sum_of_digits` to its binary representation. This can be done using a built-in function like `bin()` in Python or a similar function in other programming languages. The `bin()` function returns a string prefixed with "0b" (e.g., "0b101").
4.  **Return Result as String:**
    *   Remove the "0b" prefix from the binary string obtained in the previous step.
    *   Return the resulting binary string.
5.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

**Example:**

If the input `n` is 123:

1.  `sum_of_digits` will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
2.  The binary representation of 6 is "110".
3.  The algorithm will return the string "110".
