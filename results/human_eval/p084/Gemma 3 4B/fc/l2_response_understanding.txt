Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer and then convert that sum into its binary representation.  Essentially, it performs a digit sum and then a binary conversion.

**2. Input Data**

*   **n:** An integer (whole number) representing the number whose digits we want to sum.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `sum = 0`:  Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the digits.
    *   `res = ""`: Initialize an empty string variable `res`. This variable will store the binary representation of the sum.

2.  **Input:**
    *   The algorithm takes an integer `n` as input.

3.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   The algorithm iterates through the digits of the input number `n`.  This is implicitly done by repeatedly taking the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (which gives the last digit) and then dividing `n` by 10 (which removes the last digit).
    *   In each iteration:
        *   `sum = sum + digit`:  The current digit is added to the `sum`.

4.  **Binary Conversion:**
    *   `res = ""`: Reset the `res` string to empty.
    *   The algorithm converts the `sum` (which is now the sum of the digits of the original number) to its binary equivalent. This can be done using a standard binary conversion algorithm:
        *   Repeatedly divide the `sum` by 2.
        *   The remainder of each division (0 or 1) is a digit in the binary representation.
        *   The binary digits are appended to the `res` string in reverse order.

5.  **Output:**
    *   The algorithm returns the `res` string, which now contains the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input number.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a string representing the binary equivalent of the sum of the digits of the input integer `n`.

**Example:**

If `n = 1234`, the algorithm would:
