The algorithm's purpose is to convert an integer into a binary string representation. The input data required is an integer, and the main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive an integer as input (0 â‰¤ n).
2. Sum the digits of the input integer.
3. Convert the summed digits into a binary string.
4. Return the binary string as the output.

The expected output is a binary string representation of the input integer.
