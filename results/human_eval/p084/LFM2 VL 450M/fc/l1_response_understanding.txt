The algorithm's purpose is to convert a binary string into a string that can be stored as a byte array. The input data required is a binary string. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input n as integer
3. Sum the digits of n and convert it to binary
4. Return result as string
5. End

The expected output is a binary string that can be stored as a byte array.
