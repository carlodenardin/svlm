The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number. The input data required is the number to be summed. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input the number to be summed.
3. Calculate the sum of the digits of the number.
4. Convert the sum to binary.
5. Convert the binary sum to an integer.
6. End.

The expected output is the sum of the digits of the input number.
