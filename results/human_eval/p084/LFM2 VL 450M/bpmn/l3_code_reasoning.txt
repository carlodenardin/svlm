```python
def compute_res(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    sum_ = 0
    res = 0
    # two variables greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        sum_ = a + b
    if a <= 10 and b <= 10:
        res = a + b
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        sum_ = a + b
    if a <= 10 and b <= 10:
        res = a + b
    return res
