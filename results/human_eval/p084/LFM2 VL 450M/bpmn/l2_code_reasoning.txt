```python
def solution(n):
    # 1. Receive an integer number (n is received as parameter)
    # 2. Initialize two variables: sum = 0 and res = 0
    sum = 0
    res = 0
    # 3. Compute and allocate the sum of the two variables
    sum = sum + res
    # 4. Convert the sum to binary and save it in the variable
    sum = bin(sum)
    # Return the variable containing the binary representation
    return sum
