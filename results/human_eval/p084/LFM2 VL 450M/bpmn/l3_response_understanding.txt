The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of two numbers, where the sum is greater than 0. The input data required is the two numbers, represented as integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive an integer number n.
2. Initialize two variables sum and res.
3. Initialize two variables greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10.
4. If greater than 0, calculate the sum of the two numbers and store it in sum.
5. If less than or equal to 10, calculate the sum of the two numbers and store it in res.
6. If greater than 0, calculate the sum of the two numbers and store it in sum.
7. If less than or equal to 10, calculate the sum of the two numbers and store it in res.
8. Return the res variable.

The expected output is the sum of the two numbers, which is stored in res.
