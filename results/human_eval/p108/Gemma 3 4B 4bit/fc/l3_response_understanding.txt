Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

This flowchart describes an algorithm designed to determine if a number in a list of integers is divisible by 10.  It essentially checks if the last digit of each number in the list is 0.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`arr`:**  A list (or array) of integers (`int`). This is the input data that the algorithm will process.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `res = 0` (Initialize a result variable to 0. This variable will store whether at least one number is divisible by 10).
    *   `i = 0` (Initialize a loop counter `i` to 0).

2.  **Outer Loop:**
    *   The algorithm iterates through the `arr` list using the loop `i < len(arr)`.

3.  **Inner Processing (for each number in `arr`):**
    *   `n = arr[i]` (Assign the current number from the list to the variable `n`).
    *   `digits = []` (Initialize an empty list called `digits` to store the digits of the number `n`).
    *   `isNeg = 1` (Initialize a boolean variable `isNeg` to 1, indicating that the number is potentially negative).

4.  **Digit Extraction:**
    *   `n < 0`: If `n` is negative, `isNeg` is set to -1.
    *   `n = abs(n)`:  Take the absolute value of `n` to handle negative numbers.
    *   `n > 0`: If `n` is positive, the algorithm proceeds to extract the digits.
    *   `digits.append(n % 10)`:  Extract the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator (`% 10`) and append it to the `digits` list.
    *   `n = n // 10`:  Integer division by 10 to remove the last digit from `n`.

5.  **Divisibility Check:**
    *   `len(digits) > 0`: Check if the `digits` list is not empty.
    *
