Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a given list where the sum of their digits is greater than 0.  Essentially, it's checking for numbers that have at least one non-zero digit.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  These integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input:** The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.
3.  **Loop:** The algorithm iterates through each integer in the input list.
4.  **Digit Sum Calculation:** For each integer in the list, the algorithm calculates the sum of its digits.
    *   This involves converting the integer to a string.
    *   Iterating through the characters of the string (each character representing a digit).
    *   Converting each character back to an integer and adding it to the running sum.
5.  **Condition Check:** After calculating the digit sum, the algorithm checks if the sum is greater than 0.
6.  **Increment Count:** If the digit sum is greater than 0, the algorithm increments a counter (initialized to 0 at the beginning).
7.  **Repeat:** The loop continues to the next integer in the list.
8.  **Return:** After processing all integers in the list, the algorithm returns the final value of the counter.
9.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** An integer representing the number of integers in the input list where the sum of their digits is greater than 0.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[12, 3, 45, 0, 99, 100]`.

1.  **12:** Digit sum = 1 + 2 = 3 ( > 0).  Count = 1
2.  **3:** Digit sum = 3 ( > 0).  Count = 2
3.  **45:** Digit sum = 4 + 5 = 9 ( > 0).  Count = 3
4.  **0
