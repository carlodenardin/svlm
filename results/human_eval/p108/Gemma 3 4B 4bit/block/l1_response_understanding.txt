Okay, let's break down the algorithm described in the flowchart.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a given list that have a sum of their digits greater than 0.  Essentially, it's checking if each number in the list has a positive digit sum.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  These integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

**3. Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a variable `count` initialized to 0. This variable will store the number of integers that satisfy the condition.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   Loop through each integer in the input list.

3.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   For each integer in the list, calculate the sum of its digits.
        *   Convert the integer to a string.
        *   Iterate through each character (digit) in the string.
        *   Convert each character back to an integer.
        *   Add the integer value of each digit to the `digit_sum` variable.

4.  **Condition Check:**
    *   After calculating the `digit_sum`, check if `digit_sum > 0`.

5.  **Increment Count:**
    *   If `digit_sum > 0`, increment the `count` variable by 1.

6.  **Return Value:**
    *   After iterating through all the integers in the list, return the final value of the `count` variable.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a single integer representing the number of integers in the input list that have a sum of digits greater than 0.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[12, -5, 0, 100, 23]`.

1.  `count` starts at 0.
2.  Loop through the list:
    *   `12`: `digit_sum = 1 + 2 = 3`.  `3 > 0`, so `count` becomes 1.
    *   `-5`: `digit_sum = 5`. `5 > 0`, so `count` becomes 2.
    *   `0
