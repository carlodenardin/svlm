Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to calculate the number of digits in a list of integers. It essentially counts how many numbers are present in the input list.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  These integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   A variable `res` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the count of integers.

2.  **Receive Input:**
    *   The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.

3.  **Looping (Iteration):**
    *   The algorithm enters a loop that continues as long as the list has not been fully iterated.
    *   **Extract Value:** Inside the loop, it extracts a single integer from the list.
    *   **Sum of Digits:** It calculates the sum of the digits of the extracted integer.  This is done by treating the integer as a signed number and summing its digits.
    *   **Comparison:** It compares the calculated sum of digits to 0.
        *   **If Sum > 0:**  The algorithm increments the `res` variable by 1 (meaning it has found another integer).
        *   **If Sum <= 0:** The loop continues to the next iteration.

4.  **Termination:**
    *   The loop continues until all integers in the list have been processed.
    *   **Return Result:** Once the loop completes (meaning all integers have been processed), the algorithm returns the final value of the `res` variable.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** An integer representing the number of integers present in the input list.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

1.  `res` is initialized to 0.
2.  Loop 1:
    *   Extract 1. Sum of digits = 1.  `Sum > 0` is true. `res` becomes 1.
3.  Loop 2:
    *   Extract 2. Sum of digits = 2.  `Sum > 0` is true. `
