Iâ€™m missing the actual problem statement and the VLM reasoning you want me to follow. Please provide:

- The problem description (what needs to be solved).
- The reasoning steps from the small VLM that I should translate into a Python function (the exact algorithm/approach).
- Any example inputs and the expected outputs (to verify the implementation).
- Any constraints or edge cases I should handle.
- The preferred format for the flowcharts/diagrams (ASCII diagrams are fine, or you can specify a different style).

Once I have those, I will output a Python function that strictly follows that reasoning, plus:
- a flowchart for the main body of the algorithm
- a separate diagram for each function
- a flowchart for each data input and the expected output for each function
in ASCII diagram form embedded in the code as docstrings or string literals, as requested.
