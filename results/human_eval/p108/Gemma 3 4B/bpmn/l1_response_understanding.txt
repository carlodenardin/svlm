Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers within a given list that have a sum of their digits greater than 0.  Essentially, it checks if the digits of each number in the list add up to a positive value.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  This list can contain positive, negative, and zero values.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Start with a variable `count` initialized to 0. This variable will store the number of integers whose digit sum is greater than 0.

2.  **Receive List:**
    *   The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.

3.  **Iteration:**
    *   Loop through each integer in the input list.  This is typically done using a `for` loop or a similar iteration mechanism.

4.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   For each integer in the list, calculate the sum of its digits.
        *   Convert the integer to a string.
        *   Iterate through the characters (digits) of the string.
        *   Convert each character back to an integer and add it to a running sum.

5.  **Comparison:**
    *   Compare the calculated digit sum to 0.
    *   If the digit sum is greater than 0, increment the `count` variable.

6.  **Return Count:**
    *   After iterating through all the integers in the list, return the final value of the `count` variable.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a single integer representing the number of integers in the input list whose sum of digits is greater than 0.

**Example:**

*   **Input List:** `[12, 34, 5, 67, 89, 0, -10]`
*   **Digit Sums:**
    *   12: 1 + 2 = 3 ( > 0)
    *   34: 3 + 4 = 7 ( > 0)
    *   5: 5 ( > 0)
    *   67: 6 + 7
