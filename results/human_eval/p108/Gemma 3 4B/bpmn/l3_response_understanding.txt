Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This algorithm appears to calculate a running sum of the digits of a list of integers. It handles negative numbers by considering the sign (positive or negative) when summing the digits.  Essentially, it's a digit-summing process with a running total.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  This is the primary data the algorithm will process.

**3. Main Logical Flow â€“ Step-by-Step**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `res = 0`:  Initialize a variable `res` (likely short for "result") to 0. This will store the running sum of the digits.
    *   `i = 0`: Initialize a counter `i` to 0. This will iterate through the list of integers.

2.  **Input Validation:**
    *   `if i < len(list)`: Check if the current index `i` is within the bounds of the input list. If not, the algorithm terminates (returns the `res` variable).

3.  **Extract Integer:**
    *   `n = list[i]`: Extract the integer at the current index `i` from the list and store it in the variable `n`.

4.  **Digit Sum Calculation:**
    *   `digits = []`: Initialize an empty list called `digits`. This list will store the individual digits of `n`.
    *   `isNeg = 1`: Initialize a flag `isNeg` to 1 (True). This flag will be used to handle negative numbers.

5.  **Handle Negative Numbers:**
    *   `if n < 0`: Check if `n` is negative.
        *   `isNeg = -1`: If `n` is negative, set `isNeg` to -1 (False).
        *   `n = abs(n)`: Take the absolute value of `n` to work with the positive magnitude of the number.

6.  **Digit Extraction and Summation:**
    *   `while n > 0`:  Loop as long as `n` is greater than 0.
        *   `digits.append(n % 10)`: Calculate the remainder when
