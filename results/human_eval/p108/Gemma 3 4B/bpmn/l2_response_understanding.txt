Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to be designed to count the number of positive integers within a given list of integers. It does this by iteratively summing the values in the list and incrementing a counter only if the sum exceeds zero.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  This list can contain both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive List:** The algorithm begins by receiving a list of integers as input.
2.  **Initialization:** A variable named `res` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the count of positive integers encountered.
3.  **Loop Condition Check:** The algorithm checks if the list has been fully iterated through. If not, it proceeds to the next step.
4.  **Extract Value:**  The algorithm extracts the next integer value from the input list.
5.  **Sum Calculation:** The extracted integer is added to the current value of the `res` variable.
6.  **Sum Comparison:** The algorithm compares the current value of `res` (the running sum) with 0.
    *   **If `res` > 0:** This means the sum is positive, indicating that at least one positive integer has been encountered. The `res` variable is incremented by 1.
    *   **If `res` <= 0:** This means the sum is zero or negative, indicating that no positive integers have been encountered so far.  The `res` variable remains unchanged.
7.  **Loop Iteration:** The algorithm returns to step 3 (Loop Condition Check) to process the next integer in the list.
8.  **Return Result:** Once the loop completes (meaning all integers in the list have been processed), the algorithm returns the final value of the `res` variable. This value represents the number of positive integers in the input list.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** An integer representing the number of positive integers present in the input list.

**Example:**

If the input list is `[-1, -2, 3, 4, -5]`, the algorithm would proceed as follows:

1.  `res = 0`
2.  Extract
