Okay, let's break down the algorithm described by the flowchart.

**Overview:**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a given list where the sum of their digits is greater than 0.  Essentially, it checks if each number has a non-zero digit sum.

**Input Data:**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  These integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

**Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a counter variable (e.g., `count = 0`). This variable will store the number of integers that meet the criteria.

2.  **Iterate through the List:**
    *   Use a loop (e.g., a `for` loop) to iterate through each integer in the input list.

3.  **Calculate the Sum of Digits:**
    *   For each integer in the list:
        *   Convert the integer to a string.
        *   Iterate through the characters (digits) of the string.
        *   Convert each character back to an integer.
        *   Add the integer value of each digit to a running sum.

4.  **Check the Sum:**
    *   After calculating the sum of digits for the current integer, check if the sum is greater than 0.

5.  **Increment the Counter:**
    *   If the sum of digits is greater than 0, increment the `count` variable.

6.  **Return the Count:**
    *   After iterating through all the integers in the list, return the final value of the `count` variable.

**Expected Output:**

The algorithm will return a single integer representing the number of integers in the input list whose sum of digits is greater than 0.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[12, -34, 5, 0, 100]`.

1.  `12`: Sum of digits = 1 + 2 = 3.  3 > 0, so `count` becomes 1.
2.  `-34`: Sum of digits = 3 + 4 = 7.  7 > 0, so `count` becomes 2.
3.  `5`: Sum of digits = 5.
