Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a given list where the sum of the digits of each integer is greater than 0.  Essentially, it's checking for integers that have at least one non-zero digit.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  This list can contain positive, negative, and zero values.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input a list of integers:** The algorithm receives a list of integers as input. Let's call this list `numbers`.
3.  **Loop through the list:** The algorithm iterates through each integer `num` in the `numbers` list.
4.  **Calculate the sum of digits:** For each `num`, the algorithm calculates the sum of its digits. This can be done by:
    *   Converting the integer to a string.
    *   Iterating through the characters of the string (each character representing a digit).
    *   Converting each character back to an integer and adding it to a running sum.
5.  **Check if the sum is greater than 0:** The algorithm compares the calculated sum of digits to 0.
6.  **Increment the count:** If the sum of digits is greater than 0, the algorithm increments a counter variable (initialized to 0 before the loop).
7.  **Return the count:** After iterating through all the integers in the list, the algorithm returns the final value of the counter variable.
8.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a single integer representing the number of integers in the input list where the sum of their digits is greater than 0.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `[12, 345, 6, 0, -78, 99]`
*   **Process:**
    *   12: Sum of digits = 1 + 2 = 3 ( > 0) – Count = 1
    *   345: Sum of digits = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 ( > 0) – Count = 2
