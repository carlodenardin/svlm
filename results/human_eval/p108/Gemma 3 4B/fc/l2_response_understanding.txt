Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if the sum of the digits of a given integer is a positive number. It iterates through the digits of the integer, calculates their sum, and returns `True` (represented by "YES" in the flowchart) if the sum is greater than zero, and `False` (represented by "NO") otherwise.

**2. Input Data**

*   **`arr`:**  This is a list (or array) of integers.  The algorithm expects a single integer value to be present within this list.  It's assumed that the list contains only one element.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `res = 0`:  A variable `res` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the result (whether the sum of digits is positive or not).

2.  **Looping:**
    *   `has the list been fully iterated?`:  The algorithm enters a loop that continues as long as the list `arr` has not been fully iterated.
    *   If `has the list been fully iterated?` is `NO`:
        *   `Create a list containing all the digits of the array value`: The integer value within the list `arr` is converted into a list of its individual digits.  This is done by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and taking the remainder.
        *   `Compute the sum of the digits`: The sum of all the digits in the list is calculated.
        *   `sum > 0?`:  The algorithm checks if the calculated `sum` is greater than 0.
            *   If `sum > 0` is `YES`:
                *   `res = +1`: The `res` variable is set to 1.
            *   If `sum > 0` is `NO`:  (The sum is not greater than 0)
                *   The loop continues to the next iteration.

3.  **Output:**
    *   `End`: The loop terminates.
    *   `res`: The final value of `res` (which will be either 0 or 1) is returned as the output.

**4. Expected Output**
