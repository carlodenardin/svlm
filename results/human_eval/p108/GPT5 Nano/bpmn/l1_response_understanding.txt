Certainly! Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm based on the provided flowchart:

---

### Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose
The algorithm counts how many integers in a provided list have **a sum of digits greater than 0**.

---

### Input Data Required
- **A list of integers** (e.g., `[10, 0, 25, -3]`)

---

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive a List**: The algorithm begins by receiving a list of integers as input.
2. **Initialize Counter**: Set a counter (`count`) to 0.
3. **Process Each Value**:
    - Loop through **each integer** in the list.
    - For each integer:
        - Compute the **sum of its digits** (ignore the sign for negative numbers).
        - If the sum of digits **is greater than 0**, increment the counter by 1.
4. **Return Result**: After all values in the list are processed, return the counter's value.

---

### Expected Output
- **A single integer** representing how many numbers in the input list have a sum of digits greater than 0.

---

### Example Implementation (Python-style pseudocode)

```python
def count_sum_of_digits_greater_than_zero(numbers):
    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num)))
        if digit_sum > 0:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
# Input: [10, 0, 25, -3]
# Output: 3  (since 10 => 1+0=1, 0=>0, 25=>2+5=7, -3=>3)
```

---

**Summary**:  
- **Input:** List of integers.
- **Process:** For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits and count those with sum > 0.
- **Output:** Total count of such integers.
