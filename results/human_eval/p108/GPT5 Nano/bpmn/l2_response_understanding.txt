Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of the algorithm presented in the flowchart:

---

### **1. Overview of the Algorithm’s Purpose**
The algorithm counts how many numbers in a given list of integers have a **sum of their signed digits** (i.e., taking each digit with its original sign) that is greater than zero.

---

### **2. Input Data Required**
- **Input:** A list of integers (e.g., `[123, -45, 12, -8]`)

---

### **3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-step Process)**
1. **Receive a list of integers.**
2. **Initialize** a result variable: `res = 0`
3. **Iterate through each integer in the list**:
    - For each integer, **compute the sum of its signed digits**.
      - Example for -45: Sum = (-4) + (-5) = -9.
    - **Check if the sum is greater than 0**:
        - **If YES:** Increment the result variable `res` by 1.
        - **If NO:** Do nothing, move to the next integer.
4. **Repeat** steps 3a–3c until the list has been fully iterated.
5. **Return** the value stored in `res`.

---

### **4. Expected Output**
- The final output is the value of `res`:  
  **An integer representing how many numbers in the list had a sum of signed digits greater than 0.**

---

## **Sample Implementation Outline (Python-like Pseudocode):**

```python
def count_positive_digit_sums(int_list):
    res = 0
    for num in int_list:
        # Compute sum of signed digits
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) if num >= 0 else -int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num)))
        if digit_sum > 0:
            res += 1
    return res
```

### **Summary Table**
| Step                    | Description                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**               | List of integers                                           |
| **Processing**          | For each integer, sum its signed digits and check if > 0   |
| **Accumulator**         | Increment counter `res` every time condition is met        |
| **Output**              | Number of integers whose signed digit sum is greater than 0|
