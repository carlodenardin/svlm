Certainly! Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown for implementing the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

---

### **Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

The algorithm iterates over a list of integers, analyzes each integer by splitting it into its digits, computes the sum of those digits, and counts how many values in the list have a digit-sum greater than zero. 

---

### **Input Data Required**

- `arr`: A list of integers (`List[int]`)

---

### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Initialization:**
    - Create an integer variable `res` and initialize it to 0. This will act as a counter for the matching numbers.

2. **Iteration:**
    - Loop through each element in `arr`.

3. **Processing Each Element:**
    - For the current integer, extract each digit and build a list of its digits.
    - Compute the sum of the digits.

4. **Condition Check:**
    - If the sum of the digits is greater than 0, increment `res` by 1.

5. **Repeat or End:**
    - Continue with the next element until all elements have been processed.

6. **Output:**
    - At the end, output (or return) the value of `res`.

---

### **Expected Output**

- An integer value (`res`) representing the number of elements in `arr` whose digits sum to more than zero.

---

### **Example Step-by-Step Implementation (Python)**

```python
def count_positive_digit_sums(arr):
    res = 0
    for num in arr:
        # Extract digits and sum them
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(abs(num))]  # Handles negative values too
        digit_sum = sum(digits)
        if digit_sum > 0:
            res += 1
    return res
```

### **Summary Table**

| Step                      | Action                                                              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                         | Initialize `res = 0`                                                |
| 2                         | For each value in `arr`                                             |
| 3                         | Extract digits and compute their sum                                |
| 4                         | If sum > 0, increment `res`                                         |
| 5                         | Repeat for all elements                                             |
| 6                         | Output/return `res`                                                 |
