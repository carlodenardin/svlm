The flowchart represents an algorithm for finding the least negative integer in a list of integers. The algorithm takes a list of integers as input and returns the least negative integer.

The input data required is a list of integers.

The main logical flow of the algorithm is as follows:

1. The algorithm starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, the algorithm returns 0 as the least negative integer.
2. If the input list is not empty, the algorithm initializes a variable "res" to 0 and a variable "i" to 0.
3. The algorithm then enters a loop that iterates through the input list. For each element in the list, the algorithm checks if the element is negative. If it is, the algorithm subtracts the absolute value of the element from the current value of "isNeg" and increments "n" by 1. If the element is not negative, the algorithm increments "n" by 1.
4. After the loop, the algorithm checks if "isNeg" is equal to -1. If it is, the algorithm returns "n" as the least negative integer. If "isNeg" is not equal to -1, the algorithm returns "i" as the least negative integer.
5. If "isNeg" is equal to -1, the algorithm returns "n" as the least negative integer. If "isNeg" is not equal to -1, the algorithm returns "i" as the least negative integer.

The expected output of the algorithm is the least negative integer in the input list.
