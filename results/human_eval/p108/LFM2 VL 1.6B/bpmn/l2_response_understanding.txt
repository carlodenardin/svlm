Overview:
The algorithm is designed to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It takes a list of integers as input and returns the GCD of the first integer in the list and the result of the Euclidean algorithm applied to the rest of the integers in the list.

Input Data:
- A list of integers

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize a variable'res' to 0.
2. If the list is empty, return the variable'res'.
3. If the list has been fully iterated, return the variable'res'.
4. Extract a value from the list and compute the sum of the signed digits of the value.
5. If the sum is greater than 0, return the variable'res'.
6. If the sum is less than or equal to 0, return the variable'res'.

Expected Output:
The algorithm returns the greatest common divisor of the first integer in the list and the result of the Euclidean algorithm applied to the rest of the integers in the list.
