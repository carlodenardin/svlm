### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to count the number of digits in a list of integers and return the count back to the caller. This is useful for analyzing the size of a list of integers, which can be important in various applications such as data compression, network bandwidth estimation, and memory management.

### Input Data

The algorithm requires a list of integers as input. This list can be of any size and can contain any type of integer.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive a list of integers**: The algorithm starts by receiving a list of integers from the user or another source.

2. **Count the number of digits**: For each integer in the list, the algorithm counts the number of digits. This is done by converting the integer to a string and then counting the length of the string.

3. **Return the count**: After counting the number of digits for all integers in the list, the algorithm returns the total count back to the caller.

### Expected Output

The expected output of the algorithm is an integer representing the total number of digits in the list of integers.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Receive a list of integers**: This step is typically handled by the user or another source of input.

2. **Count the number of digits**: For each integer in the list, convert the integer to a string and count the length of the string.

3. **Return the count**: Return the total count back to the caller.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDigits(list):
    count = 0
    for num in list:
        count += len(str(num))
    return count
```

### Example

Suppose the input list is `[123, 456, 789]`. The algorithm would count the number of digits for each integer:

- For `123`, the count is 3.
- For `456`, the count is 4.
- For `789`, the count is 3.

The total count is 3 + 4 + 3 = 10.

### Conclusion

The algorithm is a simple yet effective way to count the number of digits in a list of integers. It can be implemented using a straightforward loop and string conversion, making it easy to understand and use.
