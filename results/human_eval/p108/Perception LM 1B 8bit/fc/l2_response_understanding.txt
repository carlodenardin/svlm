**Algorithm Overview**
=======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of digits in a given array. It iterates through each element in the array, converts it to a string, and then computes the sum of its digits.

### Input Data
*   The algorithm requires an array of integers as input.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize Variables
*   `res` is initialized to 0.
*   `arr` is the input array.

#### Step 2: Iterate Through Array Elements
*   For each element `arr[i]` in the array:
    *   Convert the element to a string `s[i]`.
    *   Compute the sum of the digits in `s[i]`.
    *   Update `res` with the sum.

#### Step 3: Check if Array has been Fully Iterated
*   If `res` is not equal to 0, it means the array has not been fully iterated.
*   If `res` is equal to 0, it means the array has been fully iterated.

#### Step 4: Return the Sum
*   If the array has been fully iterated, return `res + 1`.
*   If the array has not been fully iterated, return `res`.

### Expected Output
*   The algorithm returns the sum of the digits in the input array.

### Implementation
```python
def calculate_sum_of_digits(arr):
    """
    Calculate the sum of digits in an array.

    Args:
    arr (list): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of digits in the array.
    """
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        s = str(arr[i])
        res += sum(int(digit) for digit in s)
    return res

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
result = calculate_sum_of_digits(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's steps, using a loop to iterate through each element in the array, converting it to a string, computing the sum of its digits, and updating the `res` variable accordingly. The function returns the sum of the digits in the input array.
