**Algorithm Overview: Counting Sum of Digits**
=============================================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to count the sum of digits in a list of integers.

### Input Data
The input data required is a list of integers.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Input Data Processing
*   The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.
*   It processes the input data to extract the sum of digits for each value.

#### Step 2: Sum of Digits Calculation
*   For each value in the list, it calculates the sum of its digits.
*   The algorithm stores the sum of digits for each value.

#### Step 3: Output
*   The algorithm returns the count of the sum of digits for each value in the list.

### Expected Output
The algorithm returns a list of counts, where each count represents the sum of digits for a corresponding value in the input list.

### Implementation
```python
def count_sum_of_digits(input_list):
    """
    Counts the sum of digits in a list of integers.

    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of counts, where each count represents the sum of digits for a corresponding value in the input list.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the counts
    counts = []

    # Iterate over each value in the input list
    for value in input_list:
        # Calculate the sum of digits for the current value
        sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(value))

        # Append the count to the list
        counts.append(sum_of_digits)

    # Return the list of counts
    return counts

# Example usage
input_list = [123, 456, 789]
counts = count_sum_of_digits(input_list)
print(counts)
```

This implementation provides a clear and concise description of the algorithm's purpose, input data, main logical flow, and expected output. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it suitable for implementation.
