**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of signed digits in a list of integers. It iterates through the list, extracting values, computing their signed sum, and then increments the result by 1 if the sum is greater than 0.

**Input Data:**
- A list of integers

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a variable `res` to 0.
2. **List Iteration**: Iterate through the list of integers.
3. **Value Extraction and Sum Computation**: For each integer, extract its value, compute the sum of its signed digits, and add it to `res`.
4. **Sum Comparison**: Compare the sum with 0. If it's greater, increment `res` by 1.
5. **Return**: After iterating through the entire list, return `res`.

**Expected Output:**
The final value of `res` after iterating through the list of integers.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Define a function `calculate_sum_of_signed_digits` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of their signed digits.
2. Initialize a variable `res` to 0.
3. Iterate through the list of integers.
4. For each integer, extract its value, compute the sum of its signed digits, and add it to `res`.
5. After iterating through the entire list, return `res`.

**Example Use Case:**
Input: `[123, 456, 789]`
Output: `123 + 456 + 789 = 1296`

This algorithm efficiently calculates the sum of signed digits in a list of integers by iterating through the list, extracting values, computing their signed sum, and incrementing the result if necessary.
