The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a list of integers. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input a list of integers
3. For each value of the list, count how many sum of digits are greater than 0
4. Return the count
5. End

The expected output is the count of integers in the list.
