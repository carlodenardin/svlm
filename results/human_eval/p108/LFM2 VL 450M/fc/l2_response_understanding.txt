The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a list of integers has been fully traversed. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if the list is empty (res = 0)
3. If the list is empty, return "End"
4. If the list is not empty, check if the list is fully traversed (has a length greater than 0)
5. If the list is fully traversed, create a list containing all the digits of the array's value
6. Compute the sum of the digits
7. If the sum of the digits is equal to 1, return "End"
8. If the sum of the digits is not equal to 1, return "End"

The expected output is "End" if the list is fully traversed, and "End" otherwise.
