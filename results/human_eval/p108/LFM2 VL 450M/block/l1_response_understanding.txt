The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a list and return the count. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of integers as input.
2. Count how many integers are greater than 0.
3. Return the count.

The expected output is the count of integers in the list.
