The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of integers in a list and then return the count. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Initialize a counter variable to 0
3. Loop through each integer in the list
4. If the counter is greater than 0, increment the counter
5. Return the counter

The expected output is the count of integers in the list.
