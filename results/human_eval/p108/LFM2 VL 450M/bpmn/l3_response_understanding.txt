The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given flag value is equal to a specified value. The input data required is the flag value and the value to compare it against. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Initialize variables: Set the flag value to 1 and the value to compare against to 0.
2. Return the res variable: Return the flag value.
3. If the flag value is equal to 0, return the res variable.
4. If the flag value is not equal to 0, extract the value from the res variable.
5. If the flag value is equal to 1, set the flag value to 1.
6. If the flag value is not equal to 1, set the flag value to 0.
7. If the flag value is equal to 0, set the flag value to 1.
8. If the flag value is not equal to 0, set the flag value to 0.
9. If the flag value is equal to 1, set the flag value to 0.
10. If the flag value is not equal to 1, set the flag value to 1.
11. If the flag value is equal to 0, increase the res variable by 1.
12. If the flag value is not equal to 0, increase the res variable by 1.

The expected output is the flag value.
