The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to process a list of integers and determine the sum of their digits, considering negative numbers. Here's a step-by-step description of the implementation:

1. **Start**: The algorithm begins at the "Start" node.
2. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - An integer array `arr` is provided as input.
   - Initialize a variable `res` to store the cumulative sum of digits, setting it to 0.
   - Set an index variable `i` to 0 for iteration purposes.
3. **Check Length**:
   - Enter a decision loop where it checks if `i` is less than the length of the array (`len(arr)`). If true, proceed; otherwise, exit the loop.
4. **Extract Element**:
   - If `i` is within bounds, extract the current element from the array and initialize an empty list `digits` along with a boolean flag `isNeg` set to 1 (indicating the number is negative).
5. **Determine Sign**:
   - Check if `isNeg` is equal to -1. If so, update `isNeg` to -1 indicating that we are dealing with a negative number.
6. **Calculate Absolute Value**:
   - Compute the absolute value of the extracted number using `n = abs(n)`.
7. **Extract Digits**:
   - While `n` is greater than 0, perform these steps:
     - Append the last digit of `n` (using `digits.append(n%10)`) to the `digits` list.
     - Update `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n = n // 10`).
8. **Check Sum of Digits**:
   - Evaluate whether the sum of the digits in the `digits` list exceeds 0.
   - If yes, increment `res` by 1.
9. **Increment Index**:
   - Increment the index variable `i` by 1 (`i += 1`) to move to the next element in the array.
10. **End**: Repeat the above steps until all elements in the array have been processed.
11. **Output Result**: Once all iterations are complete, the final result stored in `res` will be the desired output.

**Expected Output**: The total sum of the digits of all integers in the given array, accounting for sign changes when encountering negative numbers.
