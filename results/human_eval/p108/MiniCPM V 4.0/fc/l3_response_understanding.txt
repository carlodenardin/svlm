The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to process an array of integers and compute a result based on specific conditions. Here's a step-by-step description:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this algorithm is to iterate through an integer array, handle negative numbers by converting them into their absolute values, accumulate digits from these values, and finally sum up all accumulated digits to produce a final result.

### Input Data:
- `arr`: An array of integers.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: The algorithm begins with initializing variables.
   - `res` is set to 0.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
2. **Check Array Length**:
   - Evaluate if `i` is less than the length of the array (`len(arr)`). If not, proceed to calculate the result.
3. **Process Each Element**:
   - For each element `n` in the array:
     - Set `digits` as an empty list.
     - Set `isNeg` to 1 (indicating that the current number might be negative).
4. **Handle Negative Numbers**:
   - Check if `n` is less than 0.
     - If true, convert `n` to its absolute value using `abs(n)`.
     - Update `isNeg` to -1 indicating itâ€™s now handling a positive number.
5. **Extract Digits**:
   - Extract the last digit of `n` using `n % 10`.
   - Append this extracted digit to the `digits` list.
6. **Update Number**:
   - Divide `n` by 10 to remove the last digit.
7. **Check for More Digits**:
   - Repeat steps 5 and 6 until no more digits are left in `n`.
8. **Accumulate Digits**:
   - Sum all elements in the `digits` list.
   - If the sum is greater than 0, increment `res` by 1.
9. **Increment Counter**:
   - Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next element in the array.
10. **End**: Once all elements have been processed, end the loop.

### Expected Output:
The output of the algorithm will be the calculated result stored in `res`, which represents the cumulative sum of certain properties derived from processing the input array of integers.
