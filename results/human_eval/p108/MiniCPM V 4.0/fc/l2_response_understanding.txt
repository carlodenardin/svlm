The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to compute the sum of digits in an integer array. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Algorithm Overview
The purpose of this algorithm is to calculate the total sum of all digits present in each element of an integer array.

### Input Data
- **arr**: A list of integers (`list[int]`) that needs processing.

### Main Logical Flow
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set `res` to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of the digits.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Begin with a loop to traverse through each element in the input array `arr`.

3. **Check for Full Iteration**:
   - Within the loop, check if the iteration has reached the end of the array. If not, proceed; otherwise, exit the loop.

4. **Extract Digits from Each Element**:
   - For each element in the current iteration, create a new list containing only its digits. This can be achieved by converting the number to a string and then extracting individual characters (digits).

5. **Compute Sum of Digits**:
   - Calculate the sum of the digits extracted in the previous step.

6. **Check if Sum is Greater than Zero**:
   - If the calculated sum is greater than zero, increment `res` by 1. Otherwise, continue without modifying `res`.

7. **Repeat Until All Elements are Processed**:
   - Repeat steps 3 to 6 until no more elements remain in the array.

8. **Output Result**:
   - Once the entire array has been processed, output the value of `res`, which represents the final sum of the digits.

### Expected Output
The expected output is an integer representing the sum of all the digits across all elements in the given integer array.

This process ensures that every digit within the array is considered once, providing an accurate summation of the array's numerical components.
