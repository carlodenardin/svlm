The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to calculate the sum of digits within an integer array. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the "Start" node.
2. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - An integer array `arr` is defined as input data.
   - A variable `res` is initialized to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of the digits.
3. **Iterate Through Array**: 
   - The loop continues while there are elements left in the array (`has the list been fully iterated?`).
4. **Digit Extraction and Summation**:
   - For each element in the array, create a new list containing only its digits.
   - Compute the sum of these digits.
5. **Check Sum Condition**:
   - If the computed sum is greater than 0, increment the result by 1 (`res += 1`).
6. **Loop Termination**:
   - If no more sums need to be calculated (i.e., `sum > 0`), exit the iteration loop.
7. **End**: Once all iterations are complete, the process ends with the output being stored in `res`.

**Input Data**:
- An integer array `arr` where each element can contain multiple digits.

**Expected Output**:
- The final value of `res`, representing the total sum of all digit values across the entire array.

This straightforward approach ensures that every digit from the array's elements contributes to the overall summation without repetition or omission.
