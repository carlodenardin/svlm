The purpose of the algorithm is to count how many digits in a given list of integers sum up to greater than 0.

Input Data:
- A list of integers.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start the process.
2. Input the list of integers into the system.
3. Initialize a counter variable to zero. This will keep track of the number of sums that are greater than 0.
4. Use a loop to iterate through each integer in the input list.
5. For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits.
6. Check if the digit sum is greater than 0.
7. If the condition in step 6 is true, increment the counter by 1.
8. After processing all integers in the list, return the value of the counter as the output.
9. End the process.

Expected Output:
- The total count of integers whose digit sums exceed zero.

This flowchart outlines a straightforward approach using loops and conditional checks to achieve the desired result efficiently.
