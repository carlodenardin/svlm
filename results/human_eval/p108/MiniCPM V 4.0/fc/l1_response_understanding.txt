The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to count the number of integers in a list whose digits sum up to greater than zero. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the 'Start' node.
2. **Input List of Integers**: The first action is to receive or input a list of integers into the system.
3. **Initialize Count**: Set a variable, say `count`, to 0. This will keep track of how many numbers meet the specified condition.
4. **Iterate Through List**: Use a loop (e.g., for loop) to iterate through each integer in the provided list.
5. **Check Digit Sum**: For each integer within the list:
   - Convert the integer to a string to easily access individual digits.
   - Calculate the sum of these digits using a function that sums their values.
   - If the digit sum is greater than 0, increment the `count` variable by 1.
6. **Return Count**: After iterating through all integers, return the value stored in the `count` variable as the output.
7. **End**: The process concludes at the 'End' node.

This implementation ensures that every integer in the list is evaluated based on its digit sum, and the final result is the total count of such integers.
