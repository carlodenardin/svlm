The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to process a list of integers and count how many values have a sum of digits greater than zero. Here is a step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input Data**: The input required is a list of integers. This data will be processed to determine if each integer's digit sum exceeds zero.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize a counter variable to zero, which will keep track of numbers meeting the specified condition.

3. **Iteration Through List**: Use a loop to iterate through each integer in the provided list.

4. **Digit Sum Calculation**: For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits using modular arithmetic (e.g., `sum = 0;` while `num > 0`).

5. **Condition Check**: If the calculated sum of digits is greater than zero, increment the counter by one.

6. **Output Result**: After processing all integers, output the final count as determined by the counter.

This structured approach ensures that every element in the list is evaluated correctly according to the defined criteria.
