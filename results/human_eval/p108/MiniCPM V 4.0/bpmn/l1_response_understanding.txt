The purpose of the algorithm is to count how many values in a list of integers have a sum of digits greater than 0.

**Input Data:**
- A list of integers.

**Main Logical Flow:**
1. **Start**: Begin processing with an empty counter initialized to zero.
2. **Receive Input**: Receive the list of integers as input.
3. **Iterate Through List**: Loop through each integer value in the received list.
4. **Calculate Digit Sum**: For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits.
5. **Check Condition**: Determine if the calculated digit sum is greater than 0.
6. **Increment Counter**: If the condition is true, increment the counter by one.
7. **Output Result**: After iterating through all integers, output the final count stored in the counter.
8. **End**: The process concludes.

**Expected Output:**
- The number of integers in the input list where the sum of their digits exceeds zero.

This step-by-step explanation outlines the implementation logic required for solving the problem using the provided flowchart.
