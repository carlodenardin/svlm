The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to compute the sum of signed digits in a list of integers. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Input**: Receive a list of integers as input.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize a variable `res` to 0. This will store the cumulative sum of the signed digits.
3. **Iteration Check**: Determine if the list has been fully iterated over. If yes, proceed to return the result stored in `res`.
4. **Digit Extraction and Summation**: Extract a value from the current position in the list and calculate the sum of its signed digits.
5. **Condition Check**: Verify whether the computed sum is greater than 0.
   - If no (sum is not greater than 0), do nothing further with this iteration.
   - If yes (sum is greater than 0), increment the `res` variable by 1.
6. **Loop Continuation**: Return to the beginning of the loop to process the next integer in the list until all elements have been considered.
7. **Output**: The final value of `res` represents the total sum of the signed digits across all numbers in the provided list.

This structured approach ensures that each digit within the numbers is correctly evaluated for sign and summation before moving on to the subsequent number.
