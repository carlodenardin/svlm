The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to process a list of integers. Here's a step-by-step description of its implementation:

1. **Receive a List of Integers**: The input is a list of integers named `n`.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Set the result variable `res` to 0 and initialize an index variable `i` to 0.
3. **Check if i is Smaller than len(list)**: If true, return the current value of `res`.
4. **Extract the i-th Value from the List**: Retrieve the integer at position `i` in the list and store it in a variable `n`.
5. **Initialize Digits Variable**: Create an empty array called `digits` to hold individual digits of `n`.
6. **Set Flag isNeg to -1**: Initialize a flag indicating whether the number is negative.
7. **Check if n is Smaller than 0**:
   - If true, set `isNeg` to 1 (indicating a negative number).
   - If false, proceed without changing `isNeg`.
8. **Set n Equal to Absolute Value**: Convert `n` to its absolute value for further processing.
9. **Loop Through Each Digit**:
   - Extract each digit by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 and appending the remainder to `digits`.
   - Update `n` with the quotient after each division operation.
10. **Check Last Element of Digits Array**:
    - Multiply all elements in `digits` by `isNeg`.
    - If the sum of these multiplied values is greater than 0, increment `res` by 1.
11. **Increment Index and Loop**: Increment the loop counter `i` and repeat steps 4 to 10 until all indices have been processed.
12. **Return Result**: After completing the iterations, return the final value of `res`.

**Expected Output**: The output will be the modified result based on the given list of integers following the specified transformations and conditions outlined in the flowchart.
