The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to process a list of integers. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this algorithm is to count how many digits in each integer sum to greater than 0 and return that count for each value in the input list.

### Input Data:
- **Input**: A list of integers as input. This means the function will receive an array or collection containing multiple integer values.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receive List of Integers**: Start by accepting the list of integers as input.
2. **Initialize Count Variable**: Set up a variable, say `count`, to keep track of the number of non-zero digit sums for each element.
3. **Iterate Over Each Integer**: Use a loop (e.g., `for` loop) to go through each integer in the provided list.
4. **Calculate Sum of Digits**: For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits using modular arithmetic (`sum = sum + num % 10`) until the last digit becomes zero.
5. **Check if Sum is Greater Than Zero**: If the calculated sum is greater than zero, increment the `count` variable.
6. **Return Final Count**: After processing all integers, return the final value of the `count` variable which represents the total count of numbers with at least one non-zero digit sum.

### Expected Output:
The output should be an integer representing the total count of elements from the input list where the sum of their digits exceeds zero.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in implementing the logic required by the given flowchart.
