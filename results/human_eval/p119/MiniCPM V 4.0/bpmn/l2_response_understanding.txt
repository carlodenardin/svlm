The algorithm depicted in the flowchart appears to involve two main processes: concatenating a list of strings and checking string balance. Here's a step-by-step description based on the provided image:

1. **Receive Input Data:**
   - The process starts by receiving a list composed of two strings as input data.

2. **Concatenate Strings:**
   - Concatenate the given strings together with both combinations (e.g., "ab" + "cd").

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Initialize counters or variables `c1` and `c2` using a function named `check_string(s)` for each combination of strings obtained from the previous step.

4. **Check String Balance:**
   - Receive another string to check its balance status.
   - Use the `check_string(s)` function to determine if the string is balanced according to specific criteria (every '(' has a matching ')', and closures never exceed openings in order).

5. **Decision Point:**
   - If the received string is not balanced (`No`), return 'No'.
   - If the received string is balanced (`Yes`), proceed further.

6. **Output Result:**
   - Return 'Yes' indicating that the string is balanced.

**Expected Output:**
- Based on whether the final processed string meets the balancing conditions defined within the `check_string(s)` function, the output will be either 'Yes' or 'No'.

This structured approach ensures that all necessary checks are performed systematically before arriving at a definitive result regarding the string's balance.
