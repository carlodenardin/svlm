    Given a list of two strings, concatenate them and determine
    if there exists at least one balanced segment where '<' acts as
    an opening bracket and ')' acts as a closing bracket.
    A balanced segment is one where the number of '<' never falls
    below the number of ')' when scanned left-to-right, and ultimately
    the segment ends with equal numbers of both (balance returns to zero).
