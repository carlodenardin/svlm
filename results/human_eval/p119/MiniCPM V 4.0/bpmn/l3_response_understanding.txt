The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to check if a given string is composed of two concatenated strings. Here's the step-by-step process for implementation:

### Purpose:
The primary purpose of this algorithm is to determine whether a provided string can be split into exactly two substrings by concatenating them together in different orders and checking their equality with the original input string.

### Input Data Required:
1. A list containing two strings.
2. The function `check_string(s)` which will perform the checks on individual characters.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receive the List**: Start by receiving the list consisting of two strings.
2. **Concatenate Strings**: Concatenate these two strings together.
3. **Initialize Variables**: Set up initial variables, such as `c1` and `c2`, representing potential combinations of the concatenated strings.
4. **Check Combinations**: Use the function `check_string(s)` to compare each combination (`c1` or `c2`) against the concatenated result from step 2.
5. **Decision Points**:
   - If either `c1` or `c2` matches the concatenated string, return "Yes".
   - Otherwise, continue looping through other possible combinations until all possibilities are checked.
6. **Loop Through Characters**: For any remaining unchecked substring after combining, iterate over its characters using the `check_string(s)` function.
7. **Update Indices**: Increment indices based on character comparisons within the current substring.
8. **Final Decision**: If no valid combination returns true, conclude that there is no match and return "False".

### Expected Output:
- The output will be either "Yes" if the input string is formed by concatenating two specified strings, or "False" otherwise.

This structured approach ensures thorough examination of all possible ways to form the target string from smaller parts, making it robust for various testing scenarios.
