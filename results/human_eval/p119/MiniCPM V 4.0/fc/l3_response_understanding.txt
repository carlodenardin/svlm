The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to check if a given string contains the substring '('. Here's a step-by-step description of the implementation:

1. **Input Data**: 
   - The input is a list of strings (`I: list[str]`).
   - An individual string `s` needs to be processed for checking the presence of the substring '('.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two variables, `c1` and `c2`, by calling functions `check_string(s1)` and `check_string(s2)` respectively. These functions presumably return boolean values indicating whether each part of the concatenated string contains the substring '('.

3. **Decision Point**:
   - Check if either `c1` or `c2` is true. If at least one returns true, proceed with "Yes" as output; otherwise, end the process.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - Start a function named `fnc: check_string` which iterates through the characters of the current string `s`.
   - Use a loop that continues while the length of `s` is greater than zero (`i < len(s)`).

5. **Character Processing**:
   - Inside the loop, compare the character at position `i` in `s` with the substring '('.
   - If they match, set a counter `c` to 1 and break out of the inner loop since we have found the required substring.
   - If no match occurs after processing all characters up to `i`, reset `c` to 0 and continue checking subsequent characters.

6. **Final Decision**:
   - After exiting the loop (either due to finding '(' or reaching the end of the string), evaluate the value of `c`.
   - If `c` equals 0, it means '(' was not found in the entire string, so conclude with "False".
   - Otherwise, conclude with "True".

7. **Output**:
   - The expected output is a boolean result indicating whether the original string contains the substring '('.

This structured approach ensures thorough examination of the input string for the specified substring, making use of loops and conditional checks effectively.
