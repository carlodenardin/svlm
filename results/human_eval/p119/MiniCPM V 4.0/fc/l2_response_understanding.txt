The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to validate the balancedness of a string composed of rounded parentheses. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Input Data**: 
   - A list `I` containing the input string `str` is provided.
3. **String Splitting**: 
   - The input string `str` is split into two parts, `s1` and `s2`, representing the opening and closing parentheses respectively.
4. **Validation Check**: 
   - Each part (`s1` and `s2`) is checked for validity using a function named `check_string`. This ensures that every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis and that no closure exceeds its corresponding opening in order.
5. **Decision Point**: 
   - If both `s1` and `s2` are valid (i.e., return 'Yes'), the process ends successfully.
   - If either `s1` or `s2` is invalid (i.e., return 'No'), it concludes with failure.
6. **Balancedness Check**: 
   - Another validation check is performed on the entire string `s` to ensure it remains balanced after splitting.
7. **Decision Point**: 
   - If the string is found to be balanced (return 'True'), the process terminates successfully.
   - If not balanced (return 'False'), the process also ends unsuccessfully.

**Expected Output**:
- The output will indicate whether the given string of parentheses is balanced. It can be "End" if the string is balanced, otherwise indicating the reason for imbalance.

This algorithm effectively verifies the correctness of nested parentheses by ensuring each pair matches properly throughout the string.
