The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to check if a concatenated string of two given strings is balanced. Here's a detailed step-by-step description:

1. **Input Data**: The algorithm requires a list containing two strings as input. These are the strings that need to be checked for balance.

2. **Concatenation**: Concatenate the two provided strings into a single combined string. This new string will serve as the basis for checking its balance.

3. **Balance Check**: Evaluate whether at least one of the resulting concatenated strings meets the criteria for being balanced. A balanced string satisfies these conditions:
   - Every '(' has a matching ')'.
   - Closures (pairs of matching brackets) never exceed their order, meaning every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket in the correct sequence.

4. **Decision Point**: If any part of the concatenated string fails the balance check, proceed with "No" and end the process. Otherwise, move forward.

5. **Output**: 
   - If the concatenated string is found to be balanced ("Yes"), output the result indicating success.
   - If not balanced ("No"), also provide this outcome but indicate failure.

This structured approach ensures clarity in implementing the logic required to determine the balance of the concatenated strings efficiently.
