The flowchart describes an algorithm aimed at determining if a concatenated string formed from two input strings is balanced. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input Data**: The algorithm requires a list containing two strings as its primary input data. These strings will be used to form new combinations and check for balance.

2. **Concatenation Step**: 
   - Concatenate the two given strings together, forming a single longer string that includes all characters from both original strings in any order.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - Implement a function or method named `check_balance` which takes the concatenated string as input.
   - Within this function, iterate through the string while maintaining track of open and close parentheses ('(' and ')').
   - Ensure every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis and ensure that closures never exceed openings in sequence.
   - Return a boolean value indicating whether the string is balanced.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - After performing the balance check, use a decision node to evaluate the result.
   - If the condition "at least one string is balanced" holds true (i.e., the concatenated string is balanced), proceed with outputting "Yes".
   - If not, conclude with "No".

5. **Output**:
   - Depending on the outcome of the balance check, either print "Yes" if the resulting string is balanced or print "No" otherwise.
   - Both outcomes lead to ending the process by reaching the end node.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in implementing the logic required to determine the balance of the concatenated string.
