The flowchart describes an algorithm designed to check if a list of strings is balanced. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input Data**: 
   - Receive a list of 2 strings as input. These are the two combinations provided by the user or system.

2. **Concatenation**:
   - Concatenate the two strings together with both combinations included in the output string. This ensures that every character from both inputs appears once, maintaining their relative order.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - Evaluate whether at least one combination within the concatenated string is balanced. A balance condition means that for each '(' character encountered, there must be a matching ')', and the closing parentheses should not exceed the opening ones in any given section of the string.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If either combination is unbalanced (i.e., mismatched parentheses), return "No" immediately indicating failure.
   - Otherwise, proceed further since both combinations appear to be balanced.

5. **Output**:
   - Return "Yes" signifying success; all combinations are balanced according to the defined criteria.

This process involves straightforward concatenation followed by a detailed comparison to ensure proper balancing of parentheses across the combined string.
