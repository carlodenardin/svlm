The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of strings is balanced. A balanced list is one where the length of the list is equal to the number of strings in the list. The input data required is a list of strings. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of strings.
2. Check if the length of the list is equal to the number of strings in the list.
3. If the length is equal, return "Return No".
4. If the length is not equal, return "Return Yes".

The expected output is "Return Yes" if the list is balanced, and "Return No" if the list is not balanced.
