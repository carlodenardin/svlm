The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given string is a valid check string. The input data required is a string. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of 2 strings.
2. Concatene the strings with both the combination.
3. Initialize and set c1 and c2 with the result of the function check_strings(s) for each combination of strings.
4. Return 'No' if c1 or c2 is 0.
5. Return 'Yes' if c1 or c2 is 1.
6. Return 'Yes' if c1 or c2 is 0.
7. Return 'False' if c1 or c2 is 1.

The expected output is a string indicating whether the given string is a valid check string.
