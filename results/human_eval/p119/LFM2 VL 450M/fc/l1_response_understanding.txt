The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a string is balanced by checking if it is equal to the longest string in the list. The input data required is a list of strings. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. List of 2 strings
3. Check if at least one string is balanced? (This is a decision based on the length of the longest string in the list)
   - If the length of the longest string is not equal to 1, then the string is not balanced.
   - If the length of the longest string is equal to 1, then the string is balanced.
4. If the string is not balanced, then the string is not equal to the longest string in the list.
   - If the string is equal to the longest string in the list, then the string is balanced.
   - If the string is not equal to the longest string in the list, then the string is not balanced.
5. End

The expected output is a boolean value indicating whether the string is balanced or not.
