The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a string is balanced according to a specific set of rules. The input data required is a string and a set of rules. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if each string is valid according to the rules.
3. If the string is valid, check if it is composed of correct characters.
4. If the string is not valid, end the process.
5. If the string is valid, check if it is balanced according to the rules.
6. If the string is balanced, end the process.
7. If the string is not balanced, end the process.

The expected output is a boolean value indicating whether the string is balanced or not.

The algorithm uses a set of rules to check if each string is valid according to a specific set of rules. The rules are not specified in the image, but they are likely to be a set of conditions that must be met for a string to be considered valid. The algorithm then checks if the string is composed of correct characters and if it is balanced according to the rules. If the string is balanced, the algorithm ends the process, and if the string is not balanced, the algorithm ends the process.
