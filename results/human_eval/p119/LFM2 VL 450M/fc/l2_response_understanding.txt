The algorithm's purpose is to validate a string input by checking each character against a predefined set of conditions. The input data required is the string to be validated. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check each character in the string against a predefined set of conditions.
3. If any character is not valid, end the process.
4. If all characters are valid, end the process.

The expected output is the string that is valid or the string that is invalid.

The algorithm uses a series of conditional statements to check each character in the string. If a character is not valid, the process ends. If all characters are valid, the process ends. The algorithm uses a decision tree structure to make these decisions.
