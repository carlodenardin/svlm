The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given string is a substring of another string. The input data required is the two strings to be compared. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if the first string is a substring of the second string (string1) using the condition s1 = (1) or s1 = (2) and c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
3. If s1 is a substring of string1, check if s2 is a substring of string2 using the condition s2 = (1) or s2 = (2) and c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
4. If s2 is a substring of string2, check if s1 is a substring of string1 using the condition s1 = (1) or s1 = (2) and c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
5. If s1 is not a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
6. If s2 is not a substring of string2, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
7. If s1 is not a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
8. If s2 is a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
9. If s1 is not a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
10. If s2 is not a substring of string2, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
11. If s1 is not a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
12. If s2 is a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
13. If s1 is not a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
14. If s2 is not a substring of string2, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
15. If s1 is not a substring of string1, c1 = (1) or c2 = (2).
16. If s2 is a substring of string1, c1 =
