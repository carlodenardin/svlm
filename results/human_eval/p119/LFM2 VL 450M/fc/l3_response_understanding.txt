The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given string is a substring of another string. The input data required is the two strings to be compared. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if the first string is a substring of the second string (i.e., s1 is a substring of s2).
3. If s1 is a substring of s2, then check if s2 is a substring of s1 (i.e., s2 is a substring of s1).
4. If s2 is a substring of s1, then check if s1 is a substring of s2 (i.e., s1 is a substring of s2).
5. If s1 is not a substring of s2, then check if s2 is a substring of s1 (i.e., s2 is a substring of s1).
6. If s2 is a substring of s1, then check if s1 is a substring of s2 (i.e., s1 is a substring of s2).
7. If s1 is not a substring of s2, then check if s2 is a substring of s1 (i.e., s2 is a substring of s1).
8. If s2 is a substring of s1, then check if s1 is a substring of s2 (i.e., s1 is a substring of s2).
9. If s1 is not a substring of s2, then check if s2 is a substring of s1 (i.e., s2 is a substring of s1).
10. If s2 is a substring of s1, then check if s1 is a substring of s2 (i.e., s1 is a substring of s2).
11. If s1 is not a substring of s2, then check if s2 is a substring of s1 (i.e., s2 is a substring of s1).
12. If s2 is a substring of s1, then check if s1 is a substring of s2 (i.e., s1 is a substring of s2).
13. If s1 is not a substring of s2, then check if s2 is a substring of s1 (i.e., s2 is a substring of s1).
14. If s2
