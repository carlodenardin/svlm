The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given combination of strings is balanced. A balanced combination is one where every string has the same number of characters.

Input data required: A list of strings.

Main logical flow:

1. Receive a list of strings as input.
2. Check if the length of the list is even. If it's not, return "No, both strings are unbalanced."
3. If the length is even, check if the length of the first string is less than the length of the second string. If it is, return "No, both strings have the same number of characters."
4. If the length of the first string is less than the length of the second string, return "No, both strings have different lengths."
5. If the length of the first string is greater than the length of the second string, return "No, both strings have the same number of characters."
6. If the length of the first string is equal to the length of the second string, return "Yes, both strings have the same number of characters."

Expected output: A list of strings with the same number of characters.
