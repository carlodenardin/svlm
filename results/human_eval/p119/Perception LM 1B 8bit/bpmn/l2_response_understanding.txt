**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to balance two strings, ensuring that every opening and closing bracket in the string never exceeds the openings in order. It takes a list of two strings as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings are balanced.

### Input Data
*   A list of two strings, `s1` and `s2`

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Receive a List of Two Strings
*   The algorithm receives a list of two strings, `s1` and `s2`, as input.

#### Step 2: Concatenate the Strings with Both the Combination
*   The algorithm concatenates the two strings with both the combination.

#### Step 3: Initialize and Set c1 and c2 with the Result of the Function check_string(s) for Each Combination of Strings
*   The algorithm initializes and sets `c1` and `c2` with the result of the function `check_string(s)` for each combination of strings.

#### Step 4: Check if s is Balanced
*   The algorithm checks if `s` is balanced by comparing the number of opening and closing brackets in the string.

#### Step 5: Return True or False
*   The algorithm returns `True` if the string is balanced and `False` otherwise.

### Expected Output
*   The algorithm returns a boolean value indicating whether the input strings are balanced.

### Implementation
```python
def balance_strings(s1, s2):
    """
    Checks if two strings are balanced.

    Args:
    s1 (str): The first string.
    s2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the strings are balanced, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize and set c1 and c2 with the result of the function check_string(s) for each combination of strings
    c1 = 0
    c2 = 0
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] == '<':
            c1 += 1
        elif s1[i] =='greater than':
            c2 += 1
        elif s1[i] == '<':
            c1 -= 1
        elif s1[i] =='greater than':
            c2 -= 1

    # Check if s is balanced
    return c1 == c2

# Example usage:
s1 = "a b c"
s2 = "b c d"
