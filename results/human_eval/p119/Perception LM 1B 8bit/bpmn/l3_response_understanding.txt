**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose

The algorithm is designed to process a list of strings composed of two elements, `c1` and `c2`, and determine whether the strings can be concatenated. If they can, the algorithm returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Input Data

*   `c1` and `c2`: Two strings composed of two elements each.

### Main Logical Flow

#### Step 1: Receive a List of Strings

*   The algorithm receives a list of strings, `s`, which are composed of two elements, `c1` and `c2`.
*   The algorithm checks if the list contains two strings.

#### Step 2: Concatenate Strings with Combination

*   If the list contains two strings, the algorithm concatenates them with both the combination.
*   The algorithm initializes and sets `c1` and `c2` with the result of the function `check_string(s)` for each combination of strings.

#### Step 3: Check String(s)

*   The algorithm checks the string(s) for each combination of strings.
*   If the string(s) are equal, the algorithm returns `True`.
*   If the string(s) are not equal, the algorithm returns `False`.

#### Step 4: Return False

*   If the string(s) are equal, the algorithm returns `False`.
*   If the string(s) are not equal, the algorithm returns `True`.

### Expected Output

*   The algorithm returns `True` if the strings can be concatenated.
*   The algorithm returns `False` otherwise.

### Implementation
