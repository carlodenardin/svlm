**Algorithm Overview**
======================

The algorithm is designed to check if a given string is balanced, meaning every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis, and closures never exceed openings in order. The input data required is a string, and the main logical flow involves a series of checks and decisions to determine if the string is balanced.

**Input Data**
---------------

*   The input data required is a string, which is processed by the algorithm.

**Main Logical Flow**
--------------------

### Step 1: Check if each string is valid with the function check_string

*   The algorithm starts by checking if each string is valid with the `check_string` function.
*   The `check_string` function takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is valid.

### Step 2: Check if the string, composed by rounded parentheses is balanced

*   If the string is valid, the algorithm proceeds to check if it is balanced.
*   The algorithm checks if every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis, and closures never exceed openings in order.
*   If the string is balanced, the algorithm returns `True`.
*   If the string is not balanced, the algorithm returns `False`.

### Step 3: Return the result

*   If the string is balanced, the algorithm returns `True`.
*   If the string is not balanced, the algorithm returns `False`.

**Expected Output**
------------------

*   The algorithm returns `True` if the input string is balanced, and `False` otherwise.

**Implementation**
