The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to check if a given string is balanced, meaning that every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis in the correct order. The algorithm takes a string as input and performs the following steps:

1. The algorithm starts by initializing an empty list called "str" and a boolean variable "c1" to keep track of the first character encountered.

2. The algorithm then checks if the first character of the string is a closing parenthesis. If it is, the algorithm calls the function "check_str" with the first character as an argument.

3. The function "check_str" is not shown in the flowchart, but it is assumed to return a boolean value indicating whether the string is balanced.

4. If the first character is not a closing parenthesis, the algorithm calls the function "check_str" again with the second character as an argument.

5. The algorithm continues to call the function "check_str" with the next character until it reaches the end of the string.

6. If the function "check_str" returns "No", indicating that the string is not balanced, the algorithm ends.

7. If the function "check_str" returns "Yes", indicating that the string is balanced, the algorithm checks if the first character is a matching opening parenthesis.

8. If the first character is a matching opening parenthesis, the algorithm calls the function "check_paren" with the first character as an argument.

9. The function "check_paren" is not shown in the flowchart, but it is assumed to return a boolean value indicating whether the string is balanced.

10. If the function "check_paren" returns "True", indicating that the string is balanced, the algorithm ends.

11. If the function "check_paren" returns "False", indicating that the string is not balanced, the algorithm ends.

12. If the function "check_paren" returns "No", indicating that the string is not balanced, the algorithm ends.

The expected output of the algorithm is a boolean value indicating whether the string is balanced or not. If the string is balanced, the algorithm returns "True". If the string is not balanced, the algorithm returns "False".
