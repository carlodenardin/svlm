Overview:
The algorithm is designed to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

Input Data:
The algorithm requires a single input string.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start the algorithm.
2. Check if the length of the string is 0 or 1. If true, the string is a palindrome.
3. If the length of the string is greater than 1, continue to the next step.
4. Initialize two pointers, i and c, to the start and end of the string respectively.
5. While i is less than or equal to c, do the following:
   a. Increment i by 1.
   b. Decrement c by 1.
   c. Check if the characters at positions i and c are equal. If not, return "No".
6. If the loop completes without returning "No", the string is a palindrome.
7. End the algorithm.

Expected Output:
The algorithm outputs "Yes" if the string is a palindrome, and "No" if it is not.

Implementation:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    i = 0
    c = len(s) - 1
    while i <= c:
        if s[i]!= s[c]:
            return "No"
        i += 1
        c -= 1
    return "Yes"
```
