### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to determine if a given list of strings, each composed of two characters, is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every character in the list has a matching character, and the order of the characters does not exceed the expected order.

### Input Data

- **List of Strings**: A list of strings, each composed of two characters.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive a list of strings**: The algorithm starts by receiving a list of strings, each composed of two characters.
2. **Concatenate the strings with both the combination**: The algorithm concatenates the strings in the list with both the characters from the same string.
3. **Check for balance**: The algorithm checks if the concatenated string is balanced. A string is balanced if every character in the list has a matching character, and the order of the characters does not exceed the expected order.
4. **Return 'No'**: If the string is not balanced, the algorithm returns 'No'.
5. **Return 'Yes'**: If the string is balanced, the algorithm returns 'Yes'.

### Expected Output

- **Yes**: If the string is balanced.
- **No**: If the string is not balanced.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Receive a list of strings**: Initialize an empty list to store the strings.
2. **Concatenate the strings with both the combination**: For each string in the list, concatenate the string with both the characters from the same string.
3. **Check for balance**: For each concatenated string, check if it is balanced. If any string is not balanced, return 'No'.
4. **Return 'Yes'**: If all strings are balanced, return 'Yes'.

### Pseudocode

```
function isBalanced(list):
    for i from 0 to length(list) - 1:
        if list[i]!= list[i+1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently checks if a list of strings is balanced by concatenating the strings with both the characters from the same string and verifying if the resulting string is balanced. The algorithm returns 'Yes' if all strings are balanced and 'No' if any string is not balanced.
