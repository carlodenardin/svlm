Certainly! Here’s a clear breakdown of the algorithm from the flowchart:

---

### 1. Overview
**Purpose:**  
To determine if concatenating two given strings (in both possible orders) results in at least one string with balanced parentheses.  
*A string is “balanced” if every '(' has a matching ')', and closures never exceed openings in order.*

---

### 2. Input Data
- A **list** containing exactly **two strings**.  
  Example: `["(()", ")()"]`

---

### 3. Logical Flow

#### Step 1: Receive Input
- Obtain the list of two strings, let's call them `str1` and `str2`.

#### Step 2: Concatenate in Both Orders
- Create two concatenated strings:  
  - `combo1 = str1 + str2`
  - `combo2 = str2 + str1`

#### Step 3: Check for Balanced Parentheses
- For **each concatenated string** (`combo1` and `combo2`):
  1. Initialize a counter to 0.
  2. Traverse each character:
      - If `'('`, increment counter.
      - If `')'`, decrement counter.
      - If counter goes negative at any point, the string is **not balanced** (closures exceed openings).
  3. After traversal, if counter is **not zero**, the string is **not balanced** (openings without closure).
- If **at least one** of the concatenated strings is balanced, output `'Yes'`.  
- Otherwise, output `'No'`.

---

### 4. Output
- Output is either:
  - `"Yes"` (if at least one concatenation is balanced), **or**
  - `"No"`  (if neither is balanced).

---

### 5. Example Implementation Outline (Pseudocode)
```python
def is_balanced(s):
    count = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            count += 1
        elif c == ')':
            count -= 1
            if count < 0:
                return False  # More closures than openings
    return count == 0  # All opens must be closed

def main(strings):
    str1, str2 = strings
    if is_balanced(str1 + str2) or is_balanced(str2 + str1):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

---

> **Summary:**  
Given two strings of parentheses, check both concatenation orders and print "Yes" if any result is balanced; otherwise, print "No".  
**Balanced** means every opening has a closing, in order, and at no time are closures ahead of openings.
