Certainly! Here is a detailed description of the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

### **Algorithm Overview**
This algorithm determines if it is possible to create a balanced string of parentheses by concatenating two given strings of parentheses in **any order**.  
A *balanced* string means every `'('` has a matching `')'`, and at no point do closures `')'` exceed openings `'('` as the string is read left to right.

---

### **Input Data**
- **A list with two strings**: Each string consists solely of the characters `'('` and `')'`.

---

### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Receive Input**: Obtain a list containing two strings.
   
2. **String Combinations**:
    - Generate both possible concatenations:
      - Combination 1: `str1 + str2`
      - Combination 2: `str2 + str1`
   
3. **Balance Check (for each combination)**:
    - For each of the two concatenated strings:
      - Traverse the string from left to right.
      - Use a counter initialized to zero:
        - Increment counter on `'('`.
        - Decrement counter on `')'`.
      - If the counter becomes negative at any position, the string is not balanced (closures exceed openings).
      - At the end, the string is balanced only if the counter is exactly zero.
   
4. **Decision**:
    - If **at least one** of the two combinations is balanced, proceed to step 5a.
    - Else, proceed to step 5b.
   
5. **Output**:
    - (5a) If at least one combination is balanced: **Return `'Yes'`**.
    - (5b) If neither combination is balanced: **Return `'No'`**.

---

### **Expected Output**
- **'Yes'**: If a balanced combination exists.
- **'No'**: If both combinations are unbalanced.

---

### **Pseudocode Example**
```python
def is_balanced(s):
    counter = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            counter += 1
        elif char == ')':
            counter -= 1
        if counter < 0:
            return False
    return counter == 0

def can_form_balanced(strings):
    a, b = strings
    if is_balanced(a + b) or is_balanced(b + a):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```
