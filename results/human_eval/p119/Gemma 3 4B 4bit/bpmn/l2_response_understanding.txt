Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if two strings are "balanced" according to the definition provided in the flowchart: "balanced means that every '(' has matching ')' and closures never exceed openings in order."  Essentially, it checks if the parentheses in the combined string are properly nested and closed.

**2. Input Data**

The algorithm requires the following input:

*   **List of two strings (c1, c2):**  This is the core input.  `c1` and `c2` are strings that will be concatenated.  The algorithm will then check if the combined string is balanced.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive List:** The algorithm begins by receiving a list containing two strings, `c1` and `c2`.
2.  **Concatenate:** The algorithm concatenates `c1` and `c2` to create a single string.
3.  **check_string(s) Function Call:** The algorithm calls a function named `check_string(s)`. This function is the heart of the algorithm.
4.  **check_string(s) Function Implementation:**
    *   **Receive String:** Inside `check_string(s)`, the function receives a single string as input.
    *   **Is Balanced Check:** It checks if the received string is "balanced" using a boolean variable `is_balanced`.
    *   **Return Value:**
        *   If the string is balanced, the function returns `True`.
        *   If the string is not balanced, the function returns `False`.
5.  **c1 or c2 Result:** The algorithm checks the return value of `check_string(s)`.
    *   If `check_string(s)` returns `True` (meaning the combined string is balanced), the algorithm returns "Yes".
    *   If `check_string(s)` returns `False` (meaning the combined string is not balanced), the algorithm returns "No".

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will produce one of the following outputs:

*   **"Yes"**:  If the concatenated string `c1 + c2` is balanced according to the definition.
*   **"No"**: If the concatenated string `
