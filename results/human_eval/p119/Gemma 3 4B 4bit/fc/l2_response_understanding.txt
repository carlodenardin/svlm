Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given string of parentheses is "balanced."  A balanced string of parentheses means that every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' in the correct order, and the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A string `s` consisting of characters '(' and ')'.  The string can be empty, contain only opening parentheses, only closing parentheses, or a mix of both.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `s1 = [0]` : Initialize a list `s1` (or array) to store the count of opening parentheses encountered so far.  It starts at 0.
    *   `s2 = [0]` : Initialize a list `s2` to store the count of closing parentheses encountered so far. It starts at 0.

2.  **Iterate through the string:**
    *   `fnc_check_string(s)`:  This function is called to process the string `s`.

3.  **Inside `fnc_check_string(s)`:**
    *   `s = s.str`:  The string `s` is assigned to the variable `s` within the function.
    *   **Loop:** Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
        *   **If the character is '(':**
            *   `s1[0] += 1`: Increment the count of opening parentheses.
        *   **If the character is ')':**
            *   `s2[0] += 1`: Increment the count of closing parentheses.
        *   **Check for Balance:**
            *   `if s1[0] > s2[0]`:  If the number of opening parentheses encountered is greater than the number of closing parentheses, the string is unbalanced.
                *   `return False`:  The function immediately returns `False`.
            *   `else if s1[0] < s2[0]`: If the number of closing parentheses encountered is greater than the number of opening parentheses, the string is unbalanced.
                *   `return False`: The function immediately returns `False`.
            *
