    """
    Implements a flowchart-inspired procedure to approximate a quadratic root.
    Follows these steps:
    - Compute f'(x) = 2*a*x + b at current x.
    - Compute f''(x) = 2*a (constant) to determine its sign.
    - If f'' > 0, update x to the midpoint between current x and a chosen root.
    - If f'' < 0, update x to the negation of that midpoint.
    - Repeat until convergence criteria are met.
    
    This function selects the root to use for the midpoint as the real root
    closest to the current x (between the two algebraic roots).
