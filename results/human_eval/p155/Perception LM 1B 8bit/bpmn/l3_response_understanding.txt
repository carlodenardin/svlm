**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the parity of an integer `n` and return a tuple containing the parity of `n` and the parity of `n` divided by 2.

**Input Data:**
The input data required is an integer `n`.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize variables: `even = 0`, `odd = 0`, `n = abs(n)`.
   - Calculate `n % 10` to determine the remainder of `n` divided by 10.

2. **Decision Points:**
   - **n > 0:**
     - If `n` is greater than 0, increment the `odd` variable by 1.
     - If `n` is even, return a tuple containing the parity of `n` and the parity of `n` divided by 2.
   - **n % 10 == 0:**
     - If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is 0, increment the `even` variable by 1.
     - If `n` is even, return a tuple containing the parity of `n` and the parity of `n` divided by 2.
   - **n % 10!= 0:**
     - If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0, increment the `odd` variable by 1.
     - If `n` is odd, return a tuple containing the parity of `n` and the parity of `n` divided by 2.

3. **Output:**
   - Return a tuple containing the parity of `n` and the parity of `n` divided by 2.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns a tuple containing the parity of `n` and the parity of `n` divided by 2.
