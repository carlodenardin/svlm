**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to extract the last digit of a given number and increment the odd or even counter based on the digit. It takes an integer input and returns the last digit of the number.

### Input Data
*   The algorithm requires an integer input, `n`, which represents the number to be processed.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initial Conditions
*   The algorithm starts with the input `n` and initializes variables to track the parity of the number.
*   It checks if the number is even or odd by comparing the remainder of `n` divided by 2.

#### Step 2: Parity Calculation
*   If the number is even, the algorithm sets `even` to 0 and `odd` to 1, and then calculates the absolute difference between `n` and the sum of `even` and `odd`.
*   If the number is odd, `even` is set to 1 and `odd` to 0, and the same calculation is performed.

#### Step 3: Looping and Function Calls
*   The algorithm enters a loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
*   Inside the loop, it extracts the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator (`n % 10`).
*   It increments the `odd` counter based on the last digit extracted.
*   If the last digit is even, the algorithm increments the `even` counter.
*   If the last digit is odd, the algorithm increments the `odd` counter.

#### Step 4: Output
*   After the loop, the algorithm returns the last digit of `n` as the output.

### Expected Output
*   The algorithm returns the last digit of the input number `n`.

### Implementation
```python
def extract_last_digit(n):
    """
    Extracts the last digit of a given number and increments the odd or even counter based on the digit.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The last digit of the number.
    """
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    while n > 0:
        last_digit = n % 10
        if last_digit % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
        else:
            odd += 1
        n = n // 10
    return last_digit
