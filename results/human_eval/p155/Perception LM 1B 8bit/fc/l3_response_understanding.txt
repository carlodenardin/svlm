**Algorithm Overview**
=======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to determine whether a given number `n` is even or odd. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2 and checks if the result is 0.

### Input Data
* `n`: an integer representing the input number

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Calculate the remainder of `n` divided by 2
```python
def calculate_remainder(n):
    return n % 2
```

#### Step 2: Check if the remainder is 0
```python
def is_even(n):
    return calculate_remainder(n) == 0
```

#### Step 3: Determine the parity of `n`
```python
def determine_parity(n):
    return is_even(n)
```

#### Step 4: Return the parity of `n`
```python
def get_parity(n):
    return determine_parity(n)
```

### Expected Output
```python
def get_parity(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

### Implementation
```python
def main():
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    parity = get_parity(n)
    print(parity)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
The algorithm uses a simple and efficient approach to determine whether a number is even or odd. It calculates the remainder of the number divided by 2 and checks if the result is 0. If the remainder is 0, the algorithm returns `True`, indicating that the number is even. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The algorithm's implementation is concise and easy to understand, making it a reliable solution for determining the parity of a number.
