Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of even and odd digits present within a given integer. It essentially analyzes the digits of a number to determine the distribution of even and odd numbers.

**2. Input Data**

*   **n:** An integer (whole number). This is the number that will be analyzed.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Declare Variable:** A variable `n` is declared and initialized to an integer.
3.  **Count Digits:** The algorithm proceeds to count the number of even and odd digits within the integer `n`. This is likely done by:
    *   Converting the integer `n` to a string.
    *   Iterating through each character (digit) in the string.
    *   For each digit:
        *   Convert the character back to an integer.
        *   Check if the integer digit is even or odd (using the modulo operator `%`).
        *   Increment a counter for even digits if the digit is even.
        *   Increment a counter for odd digits if the digit is odd.
4.  **Store Results:** The algorithm stores the counts of even and odd digits as a tuple or pair.  The output will be a tuple or pair (even_count, odd_count).
5.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will produce a tuple or pair containing two integers:

*   **even_count:** The number of even digits found in the input integer `n`.
*   **odd_count:** The number of odd digits found in the input integer `n`.

**Example:**

If `n = 12345`, the algorithm would:

1.  Convert `n` to the string "12345".
2.  Iterate through the digits:
    *   '1' is odd: `odd_count = 1`
    *   '2' is even: `even_count = 1`
    *   '3' is odd: `odd_count = 2`
    *   '4' is even: `even_count = 2`
    *   '5'
