Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer is even or odd and to return a tuple containing the result (even/odd) and the remainder when the integer is divided by 10.  It essentially checks if a number is divisible by 2 (even) and provides a remainder when divided by 10.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer `n`.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input.
2.  **Initialization:**
    *   `even = 0` (initialized to 0)
    *   `odd = 0` (initialized to 0)
    *   `n = abs(n)` (takes the absolute value of `n` to handle negative numbers).
3.  **Initial Check:**  A conditional statement checks if `n` is greater than 0 (`n > 0`).
    *   **If `n > 0`:**
        *   `d = n % 10` (Calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10).
        *   `odd = odd + 1` (Increments the `odd` variable).
    *   **If `n <= 0`:** (This branch is not explicitly shown in the flowchart, but it's implied).  The algorithm would likely terminate or return a default value (e.g., "even").
4.  **Even Check:** Another conditional statement checks if the remainder `d` is equal to 0 (`d % 2 == 0`).
    *   **If `d % 2 == 0`:**
        *   `even = even + 1` (Increments the `even` variable).
    *   **If `d % 2 != 0`:**
        *   `odd = odd + 1` (Increments the `odd` variable).
5.  **Loop Termination:** The loop continues until `n` is equal to 10 (`n /= 10`).
6.  **Return Value:** The algorithm returns a tuple containing the `even` and `odd` variables.
