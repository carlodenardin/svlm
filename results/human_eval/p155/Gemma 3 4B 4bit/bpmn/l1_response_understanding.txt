Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to analyze an integer and determine the number of even and odd digits it contains. It returns this information as a tuple, where the first element is the count of even digits and the second element is the count of odd digits.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer (whole number).  This can be a positive, negative, or zero integer.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Integer:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer as input.
2.  **Initialization:**  Initialize two variables:
    *   `even_count = 0` (to store the count of even digits)
    *   `odd_count = 0` (to store the count of odd digits)
3.  **Iterate Through Digits:**  The algorithm iterates through each digit of the input integer.  This can be done by:
    *   Converting the integer to a string.
    *   Iterating through each character (digit) in the string.
    *   Converting each character back to an integer.
4.  **Check for Even/Odd:** For each digit:
    *   Check if the digit is even.  This can be done by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `digit % 2 == 0`, the digit is even.
    *   If the digit is even, increment `even_count`.
    *   If the digit is odd, increment `odd_count`.
5.  **Return Tuple:** After iterating through all the digits, the algorithm returns a tuple containing the `even_count` and `odd_count`.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** A tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`.  For example:
    *   If the input integer is 12345, the output would be `(2, 3)` (because there are two even digits (2, 4) and three odd digits (1, 3, 5)).
    *   If the input integer is 2468, the output would be `(4, 0)` (because all digits are even).
    *   If the input integer is 13579, the
