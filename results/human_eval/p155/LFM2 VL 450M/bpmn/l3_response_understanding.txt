The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer 'n' is odd or even. It iterates through the numbers from 0 to 'n-1' and checks if the remainder of 'n' divided by 2 is 0. If the remainder is 0, the number is odd; otherwise, it is even.

Input data required: The input integer 'n' is the number to be checked.

Main logical flow:
1. Initialize the variables 'odd' and 'even' to 0.
2. Iterate through the numbers from 0 to 'n-1'.
3. For each number 'i', check if the remainder of 'i' divided by 2 is 0.
4. If the remainder is 0, set 'odd' to 1.
5. If the remainder is not 0, set 'even' to 2.
6. Return the value of 'odd'.

Expected output: The output will be the value of 'odd' for the given input 'n'. If 'n' is even, 'odd' will be 2; if 'n' is odd, 'odd' will be 1.
