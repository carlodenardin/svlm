The algorithm's purpose is to count the even and odd digits in an input string and return a tuple containing the count of even and odd digits.

Input data required: A string of digits.

Main logical flow:

1. Receive an integer: The input string is received and converted to a string.
2. Count the even and odd digits: The string is iterated over, and each digit is checked to see if it is even or odd.
3. Return a tuple: A tuple containing the count of even and odd digits is returned.

Expected output: A tuple containing the count of even and odd digits.
