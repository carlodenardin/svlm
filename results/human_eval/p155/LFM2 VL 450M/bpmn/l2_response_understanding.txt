The algorithm's purpose is to iterate through a list of integers, incrementing the counter variable by 1 for each integer in the list. The counter variable is initialized to 0, and the loop continues until the counter variable reaches the end of the list.

Input data required: A list of integers.

Main logical flow:

1. Initialize the counter variable to 0.
2. Iterate through the list of integers.
3. Increment the counter variable by 1 for each integer in the list.
4. Return a tuple containing the counter variable and the list of integers.

Expected output: A tuple containing the counter variable and the list of integers.

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def increment_counter(numbers):
    counter = 0
    for num in numbers:
        counter += 1
    return (counter, numbers)
```

In this implementation, the function `increment_counter` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the counter variable and the list of integers. The loop iterates through the list, incrementing the counter variable by 1 for each integer, and returns the tuple containing the counter variable and the list of integers.
