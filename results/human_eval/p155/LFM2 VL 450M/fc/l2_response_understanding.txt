The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer `n` is odd or even. It uses a series of logical operations and conditional statements to evaluate the number of digits in `n` and then checks if the number of digits is odd or even.

Input data required: The input data required is the integer `n` to be evaluated.
