The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given number is odd or even. The input data required is the number to be checked. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if the number is odd or even using the modulus operator (%). If the number is odd, return "even". If the number is even, return "even". If the number is neither odd nor even, return "odd".
3. If the number is odd, return "odd".
4. If the number is even, return "even".
5. If the number is neither odd nor even, return "odd".

The expected output is "even" if the number is odd, and "odd" otherwise.
