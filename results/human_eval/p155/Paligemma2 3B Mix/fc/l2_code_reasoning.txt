I’m missing the VLM reasoning text and the problem statement you want me to implement. Please provide:

- The exact reasoning text to follow (as-is).
- The problem statement or task description.
- Desired function signature (name, inputs, outputs) and any constraints.
- Any sample input/output if available.

Once you share those, I’ll translate the reasoning into executable Python code and return only the code block.
