```python
import sys

def solve(input_data: str) -> str:
    """
    Placeholder implementation.
    The original reasoning text that drives the solution is not provided.
    This function returns an empty string as a safe default.
    """
    # Intended behavior (not implemented due to missing reasoning):
    # 1. Parse the problem input
    # 2. Apply the reasoning steps to compute the answer
    # 3. Return the answer as a string

Flowchart:

Start -> Read input -> Solve (placeholder) -> Output -> End
