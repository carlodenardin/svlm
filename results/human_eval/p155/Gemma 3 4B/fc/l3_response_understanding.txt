Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

The algorithm determines whether a given integer `n` is divisible by 10. It essentially checks if the last digit of `n` is 0.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **Input:** An integer `n`.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `even = 0` (Initialize a variable to track even numbers)
    *   `odd = 0` (Initialize a variable to track odd numbers)
    *   `n = abs(num)` (Take the absolute value of the input number `n`. This ensures the algorithm works correctly for both positive and negative numbers.)

2.  **Outer Loop Condition:**
    *   `n > 0`:  The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3.  **Division by 10:**
    *   `d = n % 10`: Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. This gives us the last digit of `n`.

4.  **Odd Number Check:**
    *   `d % 2 == 0`: Check if the last digit `d` is even.

5.  **Conditional Branching:**
    *   **If `n > 0` and `d % 2 == 0` (Last digit is even):**
        *   `even = 1`: Increment the `even` counter.
    *   **Else (If `n > 0` and `d % 2 != 0` (Last digit is odd)):**
        *   `odd = 1`: Increment the `odd` counter.

6.  **Update n:**
    *   `n = n // 10`: Integer division of `n` by 10. This effectively removes the last digit from `n`.

7.  **Loop Continuation:**
    *   The algorithm returns to step 2 (Outer Loop Condition) to repeat the process with the updated value of `n`.

8.  **Termination:**
    *   The loop terminates when `n` is no longer greater than 0 (i.e., `n` becomes 0 or negative).
