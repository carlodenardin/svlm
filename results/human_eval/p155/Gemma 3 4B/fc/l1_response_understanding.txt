Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of even and odd digits present in a given integer input. It then returns these counts as a tuple.

**2. Input Data**

*   **n:** An integer (int) â€“ This is the input number for which we want to count even and odd digits.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Declare Variable `n`:**  A variable named `n` is declared to store the integer input.
3.  **Input `n`:** The algorithm prompts the user to enter an integer value and stores it in the variable `n`.
4.  **Count Even and Odd Digits:** This is the core logic. We'll iterate through the digits of the number `n`.
    *   Initialize `even_count = 0` and `odd_count = 0`. These variables will store the counts of even and odd digits, respectively.
    *   Convert the integer `n` to a string. This allows us to easily iterate through the digits.
    *   Iterate through each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`.
        *   Convert the character digit back to an integer.
        *   Check if the digit is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If `digit % 2 == 0`, the digit is even; otherwise, it's odd.
        *   Increment the corresponding counter (`even_count` or `odd_count`) based on the digit's parity.
5.  **Output (Tuple):**  The algorithm returns a tuple containing the `even_count` and `odd_count`.
6.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a tuple of the form `(even_count, odd_count)`.  For example:

*   If `n = 12345`, the output would be `(2, 3)` (2 even digits: 2 and 4, 3 odd digits: 1, 3, and 5).
*   If `n = 2468`, the output would be `(4, 0)` (4 even
