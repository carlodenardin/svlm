Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

The algorithm appears to be designed to determine whether a given integer `n` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). It does this by repeatedly extracting the last digit of the number, checking if it's even or odd, and updating a counter accordingly.  The process continues until the number becomes zero.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **Input:** An integer `n`.  The algorithm handles both positive and negative integers by taking the absolute value.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Declare an integer variable `n`.
    *   Set `even = 0` and `odd = 0`. These variables will track the number of even and odd digits encountered.
    *   Calculate the absolute value of `n` and store it in `n`.  This ensures the algorithm works correctly for negative numbers.

2.  **Looping:**
    *   **Condition:** While `n` is greater than 0:
        *   **Extract Last Digit:** Extract the last digit of `n` (this can be done using the modulo operator `%`).
        *   **Check Even/Odd:**
            *   If the last digit is even:
                *   Increment `even` counter.
            *   Else (if the last digit is odd):
                *   Increment `odd` counter.
        *   **Update `n`:** Remove the last digit of `n` (this can be done by integer division by 10).

3.  **Output:**
    *   After the loop finishes (when `n` becomes 0), create a tuple `(even, odd)`. This tuple represents the counts of even and odd digits.
    *   Return the tuple `(even, odd)`.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a tuple `(even, odd)`.  The values in the tuple represent:

*   `even`: The number of even digits in the original integer `n`.
*   `odd`: The number of odd digits in the original integer `n`.

**Example:**

If the input `n` is 12321:

1.  `n` becomes 1
