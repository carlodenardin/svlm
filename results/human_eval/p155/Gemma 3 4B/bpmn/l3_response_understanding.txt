Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm determines whether a given integer is even or odd and also calculates the remainder when the integer is divided by 10. It returns this information as a tuple (even, odd).

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer `n`.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `even = 0` (Initialize an even flag to 0)
    *   `odd = 0` (Initialize an odd flag to 0)
    *   `n = abs(n)` (Take the absolute value of `n` to handle negative inputs.  This ensures the algorithm works correctly regardless of the sign of the input.)

2.  **Check if n is positive:**
    *   `if n > 0:`
        *   If `n` is positive, proceed to the next step.
        *   Otherwise, the algorithm implicitly assumes `n` is negative and continues with the subsequent steps.

3.  **Calculate Remainder:**
    *   `d = n % 10` (Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. This gives the last digit of `n`.)

4.  **Check for Even/Odd based on Remainder:**
    *   `if d % 2 == 0:` (Check if the remainder `d` is divisible by 2)
        *   If `d` is even, `even = 1` (Set the `even` flag to 1).
    *   `else:` (If `d` is not even)
        *   `odd = 1` (Set the `odd` flag to 1).

5.  **Check if n is equal to 10:**
    *   `if n == 10:`
        *   If `n` is equal to 10, the algorithm terminates.

6.  **Loop:**
    *   `else:` (If `n` is not equal to 10)
        *   `n = 10` (Set `n` to 10. This is the loop condition. The algorithm will repeat steps 2-6 until `n` becomes 10
