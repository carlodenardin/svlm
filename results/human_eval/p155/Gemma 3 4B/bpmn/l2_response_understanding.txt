Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of even and odd digits within a given integer. It iterates through each digit of the integer and increments the corresponding counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer (whole number).

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Integer:** The algorithm begins by receiving an integer as input. Let's call this `n`.
2.  **Initialization:** Two integer variables are initialized:
    *   `even_count = 0` (to store the count of even digits)
    *   `odd_count = 0` (to store the count of odd digits)
3.  **Digit Iteration:** The algorithm then enters a loop that iterates through each digit of the input integer `n`.  This is typically done by converting the integer to a string and then iterating through the characters of the string.
4.  **Digit Check and Increment:** Inside the loop, for each digit:
    *   The digit is extracted from the string representation of the integer.
    *   The digit is converted back to an integer.
    *   An `if` statement checks if the digit is even.
        *   If the digit is even (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), `even_count` is incremented by 1.
        *   Otherwise (if the digit is odd), `odd_count` is incremented by 1.
5.  **Return Tuple:** After iterating through all the digits, the algorithm returns a tuple containing the `even_count` and `odd_count`.  The tuple is typically represented as `(even_count, odd_count)`.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a tuple of two integers: `(even_count, odd_count)`.  `even_count` represents the number of even digits in the input integer, and `odd_count` represents the number of odd digits.

**Example:**

If the input integer is `123456`, the algorithm would:

*   `even_count` would become 3 (2, 4, 6)
*   `odd
