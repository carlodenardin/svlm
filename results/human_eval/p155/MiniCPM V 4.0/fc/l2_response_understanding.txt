The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to determine whether a given integer is odd or even by repeatedly extracting its last digit and incrementing counters accordingly. Here's a step-by-step description of the implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the 'Start' node.
2. **Input Data**: An integer `n` is required as input.
3. **Initialize Counters**: Set up two counters, `even` and `odd`, both initialized to 0. Also, calculate the absolute value of `n` for further processing.
4. **Main Loop**: Enter a loop where the condition `n > 0` holds true. This ensures that we continue until all digits have been processed.
5. **Extract Last Digit**: Extract the last digit of `n` using modulo operation (`n % 10`).
6. **Increment Counter**: Increment the appropriate counter based on the extracted last digit:
   - If the last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), increment the `even` counter.
   - If the last digit is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), increment the `odd` counter.
7. **Remove Last Digit**: Remove the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`).
8. **Decision Point**: Check if `n` is greater than 0. If not, proceed to output results.
9. **Output Result**: After exiting the loop, check which counter has reached zero first. Output a tuple `(even, odd)` indicating how many times each counter was incremented.
10. **End**: The process concludes with an 'End' node.

This logical flow efficiently determines the parity of the number through repeated iteration and conditional checks, producing a clear result of either being odd or even.
