The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step description of its implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins here.
2. **Input**: An integer `n` is provided as input.
3. **Initialize Variables**: Two variables, `even_count` and `odd_count`, are initialized to zero to keep track of the counts of even and odd digits respectively.
4. **Loop Through Digits**: 
   - Extract each digit from the integer `n` by continuously dividing it by 10 using modulus operation (`n % 10`).
   - Increment `even_count` if the current digit is divisible by 2 (even).
   - Increment `odd_count` otherwise.
5. **Output**: After processing all digits, output the values of `even_count` and `odd_count` which represent the counts of even and odd digits found in `n`.
6. **End**: The algorithm concludes here.

This structured approach ensures that every digit of the input integer is evaluated for being either even or odd, providing accurate results based on the specified conditions.
