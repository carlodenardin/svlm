The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to count the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. Here is a step-by-step description of its implementation:

1. **Input**: The input required for this algorithm is an integer, denoted as `n`.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize counters for both even and odd digits separately. Let's call these counters `even_count` and `odd_count`. Set them both to zero initially.
3. **Processing**: 
   - Iterate through each digit of the integer `n` using a loop (e.g., while loop).
   - For each iteration, extract the last digit of `n` by performing modulo operation (`n % 10`).
   - Increment the corresponding counter based on whether the extracted digit is even or odd:
     - If the digit is even (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), increment `even_count`.
     - If the digit is odd (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 1), increment `odd_count`.
   - Remove the last digit from `n` by performing integer division (`n //= 10`).
4. **Output**: After processing all digits, the final counts of even and odd digits are stored in `even_count` and `odd_count`, respectively.
5. **Termination**: End the process with the calculated counts.

This algorithm efficiently processes integers by examining their individual digits and counting how many of them are even and how many are odd.
