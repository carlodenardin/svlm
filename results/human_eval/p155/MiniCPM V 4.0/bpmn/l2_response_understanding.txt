The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to determine whether a given integer is even or odd by iterating through its digits. Here's a step-by-step description of the implementation:

1. **Receive an Integer**: Start with an input integer that needs to be analyzed for parity (even or odd).

2. **Initialize Variables**: Set up two counters, `even` and `odd`, both initialized to 0. These will keep track of how many even and odd digits are encountered during iteration.

3. **Iterate Over Digits**: Begin processing each digit of the input integer one by one. This involves converting the integer into a string so individual digits can be accessed easily.

4. **Increment Counters Based on Digit**: For each digit:
   - If the digit is even (divisible by 2), increment the `even` counter.
   - If the digit is odd (not divisible by 2), increment the `odd` counter.

5. **Return Result**: After all digits have been processed, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits found within the original integer.

This method ensures accurate identification of even and odd components in any integer provided as input, providing clear results regarding their distribution.
