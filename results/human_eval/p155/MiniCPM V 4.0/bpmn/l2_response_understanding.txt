The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to determine whether the digits of a given integer are even or odd. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: Receive an integer as input. This will be used for further processing in determining its digit properties.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize two counter variables, `even` and `odd`, both set to 0. These counters will keep track of how many even and odd digits are present respectively.

3. **Iteration**: Iterate over each digit of the received integer. For this purpose, convert the integer into a string so that individual digits can be accessed easily.

4. **Digit Processing**: For each digit obtained during iteration:
   - Convert the character (digit) back to an integer.
   - Increment the corresponding counter (`even` if the digit is even, `odd` if it's odd) based on whether the digit is divisible by 2 with no remainder.

5. **Output**: After iterating through all the digits, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits. The output format should reflect these counts clearly indicating which type of digits occurred more frequently within the input integer.

This process ensures that every digit of the provided integer is examined, and their parity (even or odd) is recorded systematically before producing the final result.
