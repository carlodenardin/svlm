The algorithm's purpose is to separate an integer into its even and odd components.

Input Data:
- An integer \( n \) as input.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Receive an integer \( n \).
2. Initialize variables:
   - Even = 0
   - Odd = 0
3. Assign the absolute value of \( n \) to a new variable \( n \).
4. Check if \( n > 0 \):
   - If No, return a tuple containing (even, odd).
   - If Yes, proceed to the next step.
5. Calculate the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 10 (\( d = n \% 10 \)).
6. Check if \( d \% 2 == 0 \):
   - If No, increase the odd variable by 1.
   - If Yes, increase the even variable by 1.
7. Divide \( n \) by 10 (\( n //= 10 \)).
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until \( n \) becomes zero.
9. Return a tuple containing (even, odd).

Expected Output:
- A tuple consisting of two integers representing the count of even and odd numbers within the given integer \( n \).

This process effectively separates the digits of the number into their respective parity classes using division and modulus operations.
