The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to separate integers into even and odd numbers. Here's a step-by-step description of the implementation:

1. **Input**: Receive an integer \( n \) as input.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize two variables, `even` and `odd`, both set to 0.
3. **Check for Even/Odd**: Determine if \( n > 0 \). If true, proceed; otherwise, return a tuple containing `even` and `odd` with values 0 and 0 respectively.
4. **Calculate Last Digit**: Compute \( d = n \% 10 \) to determine the last digit of \( n \).
5. **Decision Based on Last Digit**:
   - If \( d \% 2 == 0 \) (last digit is even), increase the `even` variable by 1.
   - Otherwise, increase the `odd` variable by 1.
6. **Divide by 10**: Update \( n \) by performing integer division \( n //= 10 \) to remove the last digit from \( n \).
7. **Loop**: Repeat steps 4 to 6 until all digits have been processed.
8. **Output**: Return a tuple containing the final values of `even` and `odd` after processing all digits of \( n \).

This algorithm effectively separates an integer into its constituent even and odd parts using logical decisions and iterative processes.
