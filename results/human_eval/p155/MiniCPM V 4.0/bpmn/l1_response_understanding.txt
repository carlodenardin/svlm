The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to process an integer and determine the count of even and odd digits within it. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: Receive an integer as input from the user or another source. This is represented by the start node in the diagram.
2. **Processing**: 
   - Initialize two counters, `even_count` and `odd_count`, both set to zero. These will keep track of the number of even and odd digits respectively.
   - Convert the integer into a string so that each digit can be individually accessed.
   - Iterate through each character (digit) in the string representation of the integer.
   - For each digit, check if it is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, it is even; otherwise, it is odd.
   - Increment the corresponding counter based on whether the current digit is even or odd.
3. **Output**: After counting all the digits, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits. The result should include values for both `even_count` and `odd_count`.
4. **End**: Terminate the function or process with the returned tuple.

This structured approach ensures accurate computation and clear communication of results, facilitating easy integration into larger software systems.
