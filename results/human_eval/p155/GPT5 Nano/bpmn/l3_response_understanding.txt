Certainly! Here is a detailed breakdown of the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

---

### **1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This algorithm counts the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. The output is a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits, respectively.

---

### **2. Input Data Required**

- **Input:** An integer `n` (can be positive or negative).

---

### **3. Main Logical Flow**

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Receive Input:**  
   Read an integer value as `n`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**  
   - Initialize `even = 0` (to count even digits).  
   - Initialize `odd = 0` (to count odd digits).  
   - Set `n = abs(n)` to ensure the number is positive for digit extraction.

3. **Loop until all digits are processed:**
   - **Condition:** While `n > 0`:
     - Extract the rightmost digit: `d = n % 10`.
     - Check if the digit is even:
       - If `d % 2 == 0`: Increase `even` by 1.
       - Else: Increase `odd` by 1.
     - Remove the processed digit from `n`: `n //= 10`.

4. **Return Result:**  
   Return `(even, odd)` as a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.

---

### **4. Expected Output**

- **Output:** A tuple `(even, odd)`, where:
  - `even` = count of even digits in `n`
  - `odd` = count of odd digits in `n`

---

### **Example Implementation (Python)**

```python
def count_even_odd_digits(n):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    n = abs(n)
    while n > 0:
        d = n % 10
        if d % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
        else:
            odd += 1
        n //= 10
    return (even, odd)
```

### **Summary Table**

| Step | Operation                          |
|------|------------------------------------|
| 1    | Receive integer `n`                |
| 2    | Set `even = 0`, `odd = 0`, `n=abs(n)` |
| 3    | While `n > 0`:                     |
| 3.a  | └─ `d = n % 10`                    |
| 3.b  | └─ If `d % 2 == 0`: `even += 1`; else: `odd += 1` |
| 3.c  | └─ `n //= 10`                      |
| 4    | Return `(even, odd)`               |
