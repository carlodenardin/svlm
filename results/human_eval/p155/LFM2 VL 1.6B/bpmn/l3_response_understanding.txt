Overview:
The algorithm is designed to calculate the probability of a certain event occurring in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. It uses a loop to iterate through the trials, updating the probability based on the outcome of each trial.

Input Data:
- n: the number of trials
- p: the probability of success in each trial

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize the probability of success (p) to 1.
2. Start a loop that iterates n times.
3. Inside the loop, generate a random number between 0 and 1.
4. If the random number is less than p, the event occurs. Update the probability of success (p) to p - (number of successes / n).
5. If the random number is greater than or equal to p, the event does not occur. Update the probability of success (p) to p + (number of failures / n).
6. After the loop, the probability of success (p) is returned.

Expected Output:
The output is the probability of the event occurring after n trials.
