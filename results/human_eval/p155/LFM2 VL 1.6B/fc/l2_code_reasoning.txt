```python
def largest_odd_divisor(n):
    # Convert to int as per the described input handling
    n = int(n)
    
    # Edge case: if n is zero, there is no positive largest odd divisor
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Repeatedly divide by 2 until the number becomes odd
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    
    return n
