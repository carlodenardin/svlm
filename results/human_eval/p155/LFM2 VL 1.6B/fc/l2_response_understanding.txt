Overview:
The algorithm is designed to find the largest odd divisor of a given integer. It starts by checking if the input number is even, and if so, it divides the number by 2 and checks if the result is odd. If the result is odd, it increments the number by 1 and checks again. This process continues until the number is odd. If the number is odd, it returns the number as the largest odd divisor.

Input Data:
The input data required is an integer.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start: The algorithm begins.
2. n = int: The input number is converted to an integer.
3. even = 0: A variable to track if the number is even is initialized to 0.
4. odd = n: The input number is stored in the variable 'odd'.
5. if odd == 0: The algorithm checks if the number is divisible by 2. If so, it divides the number by 2 and checks if the result is odd. If the result is odd, it increments the number by 1 and checks again. This process continues until the number is odd.
6. if odd > 0: The algorithm checks if the number is odd. If so, it returns the number as the largest odd divisor.
7. End: The algorithm ends.

Expected Output:
The expected output is the largest odd divisor of the input number.
