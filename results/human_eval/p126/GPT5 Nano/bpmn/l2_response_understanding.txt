Certainly! Hereâ€™s a clear, implementation-ready breakdown of the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

---

### **Overview**
This algorithm checks a list of integers to determine if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order **and** if no number appears more than twice. It returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it returns `False`.

---

### **Input Data**
- A list of integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`.

---

### **Logical Flow**

1. **Receive Input**
    - Accept a list of integers as input.

2. **Check if the List is Sorted**
    - Determine if the list is in non-decreasing order.
    - If **not sorted**, immediately **return `False`**.

3. **Check Frequency of Elements**
    - For each unique integer, count how many times it appears in the list.
    - If **any number appears more than twice**, **return `False`**.

4. **Final Result**
    - If both conditions are satisfied, **return `True`**.

### **Steps in Pseudocode**

```python
def check_list(lst):
    # Check if the list is sorted
    if lst != sorted(lst):
        return False
    
    # Check for any number appearing more than twice
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1
        if counts[num] > 2:
            return False
    
    return True
```

---

### **Expected Output**
- **Boolean value**:  
  - `True` if the list is sorted and no element appears more than twice  
  - `False` otherwise

---

### **Example**

| Input          | Output  |
|----------------|---------|
| [1, 2, 2, 3]   |  True   |
| [1, 3, 2]      |  False  |
| [1, 2, 2, 2]   |  False  |
