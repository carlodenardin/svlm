Certainly! Here’s a detailed breakdown of the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

---

### **1. Overview of the Algorithm’s Purpose**

This algorithm checks a list of integers to determine if:
- The list is non-decreasing (each element is less than or equal to the next), **and**
- No element appears more than twice.

If both conditions are satisfied, the algorithm returns **True**; otherwise, it returns **False**.

---

### **2. Input Data Required**
- A list of integers, e.g., `I: list[int]`.

---

### **3. Main Logical Flow**

#### **Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Start**
2. **Input**: Receive the list of integers (`I`).
3. **Check Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - Loop through the list from the first to the penultimate element.
   - For each index `i`, check if `I[i] <= I[i+1]`.
      - If **any** comparison fails (`I[i] > I[i+1]`), **return False** and end.
4. **Check No Number Appears More Than Twice:**
   - Count the occurrences of each number in the list.
   - For each unique number, check if its occurrence is **greater than 2**.
      - If **any** number appears **more than twice**, **return False** and end.
5. **If both checks passed**, **return True**.

---

### **4. Expected Output**
- `True` if the list is non-decreasing and no number appears more than twice.
- `False` otherwise.

---

### **Pseudo-code for Implementation:**

```python
def check_list(I):
    # Check non-decreasing order
    for i in range(len(I) - 1):
        if I[i] > I[i+1]:
            return False
    
    # Check no element appears more than twice
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(I)
    for value in counts.values():
        if value > 2:
            return False
    
    return True
```

#### **Example Usage:**
- `check_list([1, 2, 2, 3])` → True
- `check_list([1, 2, 3, 2])` → False (not non-decreasing)
- `check_list([1, 2, 2, 2])` → False (2 appears more than twice)
