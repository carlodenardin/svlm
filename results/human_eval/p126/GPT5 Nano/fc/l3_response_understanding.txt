Certainly! Here is a concise step-by-step explanation of the flowchart for implementation:

---

### **1. Overview**
**Purpose:**  
The algorithm determines if a given list of integers is strictly increasing and that no value appears more than twice consecutively.

---

### **2. Input Data**
- **Input:** A list of integers, **`l: list[int]`**

---

### **3. Main Logical Flow**

1. **Initialize:**  
   Set the index **`i = 1`** to start comparing from the second element.

2. **Main Loop:**  
   **While `i < len(l)`** (as long as there are elements left to check):
   
   a. **Strictly Increasing Check:**  
      - If **`l[i] < l[i-1]`**  
        → The sequence is not strictly increasing.  
        → **Output:** `False` (terminate).
      
   b. **No More Than Two Repeats Check:**  
      - If **`i > 1`** and **`l[i] == l[i-1] == l[i-2]`**  
        → The same value appears three times consecutively.  
        → **Output:** `False` (terminate).

   c. **Continue:**  
      - Increment **`i`** by 1 (**`i = i + 1`**) and repeat the checks.

3. **Success Condition:**  
   - If the loop completes without outputting `False`,  
     → **Output:** `True`.

---

### **4. Expected Output**
- **`True`** if the list is strictly increasing and no value occurs more than twice consecutively.
- **`False`** otherwise.

---

### **5. Ready-for-Implementation Pseudocode**
```python
def is_valid_sequence(l: list[int]) -> bool:
    i = 1
    while i < len(l):
        if l[i] < l[i-1]:
            return False
        if i > 1 and l[i] == l[i-1] == l[i-2]:
            return False
        i += 1
    return True
```

**Summary:**  
This algorithm efficiently checks if a sequence of integers is strictly non-decreasing and limits consecutive repeats to at most two occurrences.
