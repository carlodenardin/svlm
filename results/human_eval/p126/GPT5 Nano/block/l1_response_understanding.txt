**Algorithm Description Based on the Flowchart**

### 1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose
The algorithm determines whether a given list of integers is both **sorted in ascending order** and **contains no more than one duplicate of any particular number**. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

---

### 2. Input Data Required
- A single **list of integers**.

---

### 3. Main Logical Flow

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Receive Input**  
   - Accept a list of integers as input to the algorithm.

2. **Check Sorting Condition**
   - Loop through the list, and for each element, compare it with the following element.
   - If every element is less than or equal to the next element, the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - If at least one element is greater than the next, the list is **not** sorted; proceed to return `False`.

3. **Check Duplicates Condition**
   - Create a dictionary or use a frequency counter (like `collections.Counter` in Python) to count occurrences of each integer in the list.
   - Loop through the counts:
     - For each integer in the list, ensure its count does **not exceed 2**.
       (i.e., no more than one duplicate of the same number is allowed; a count of 2 is allowed, 3 or more is not.)
   - If any integer appears more than twice, the condition fails; proceed to return `False`.

4. **Return Result**
   - If **both** the list is sorted in ascending order **and** no integer appears more than twice, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### 4. Expected Output
- A single Boolean value:
  - `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order **and** no integer appears more than twice.
  - `False` otherwise.

### **Example Python Implementation**

```python
def check_list(lst):
    # Check if sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False

    # Check for no more than one duplicate of the same number
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(lst)
    for count in counts.values():
        if count > 2:
            return False

    return True
```

---

### **Usage Example**
```python
lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
print(check_list(lst))  # Output: True

lst = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
print(check_list(lst))  # Output: False (number '2' appears 3 times)
```

**Summary:**  
Feed the algorithm a list of integersâ€”it checks if the list is sorted and if no integer appears more than twice, returning `True` if both conditions hold; otherwise, it returns `False`.
