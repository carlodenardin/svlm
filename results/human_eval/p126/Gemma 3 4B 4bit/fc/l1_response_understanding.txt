Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order and contains no duplicate numbers. It essentially checks for two key properties of a sorted list: it's arranged from smallest to largest, and each number appears only once.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  This list can be of any size, and the integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input List:** The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.
3.  **Check for Sorted Order:**
    *   The algorithm compares the first element of the list with the second element.
    *   It continues comparing consecutive pairs of elements in the list.
    *   If at any point, the current element is *greater* than the next element, the list is *not* sorted in ascending order.
4.  **Check for Duplicates:**
    *   The algorithm iterates through the list.
    *   For each element, it checks if that element already exists in the list *before* the current position.
    *   If an element is found to be a duplicate, the list is *not* sorted (because duplicates violate the uniqueness requirement).
5.  **Decision Point:**
    *   If the list is sorted *and* contains no duplicates, the algorithm proceeds to the "True" path.
    *   If the list is *not* sorted or contains duplicates, the algorithm proceeds to the "False" path.
6.  **True Path:**  If the list is sorted and has no duplicates, the algorithm reaches the "True" state.
7.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** A Boolean value (True or False).
    *   **True:**  If the input list is sorted in ascending order and contains no duplicate numbers.
    *   **False:** If the input list is not sorted in ascending order or contains duplicate numbers.

**Implementation Notes (for a programmer):**

*   **Data Structures:**  The list of integers can be represented using an array or a linked list.
