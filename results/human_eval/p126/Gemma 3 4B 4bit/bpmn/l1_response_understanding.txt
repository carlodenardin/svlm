Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order and contains no duplicate numbers. It returns "True" if both conditions are met, and "False" otherwise.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list (or array) of integers.  This list can be of any size and contain positive, negative, or zero integers.

**3. Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving a list of integers as input.
2.  **Initial Check (Sort and Duplicates):**
    *   The algorithm first checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and has no duplicate numbers.
    *   This is done using a conditional statement (diamond shape).
3.  **Sorting Check:**
    *   **Decision:**  "Is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number?"
    *   If the answer is "Yes":
        *   Proceed to step 4.
    *   If the answer is "No":
        *   Return "False".  The algorithm terminates.
4.  **Sorting and Duplicate Check (Implementation Details - Assuming a basic sorting and duplicate check):**
    *   **Sort the List:**  The algorithm needs to sort the input list in ascending order.  This can be done using a standard sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Merge Sort.  (For simplicity, let's assume a sorting function is available).
    *   **Duplicate Check:** After sorting, the algorithm iterates through the sorted list. For each element, it checks if it's the same as the previous element. If it is, it means there's a duplicate.  If a duplicate is found, the algorithm immediately returns "False".
5.  **Return True:** If the list is sorted and contains no duplicates after the sorting and duplicate check, the algorithm returns "True".

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** A boolean value (either "True" or "False").
    *   "True" is returned if the input list is sorted in ascending order and contains no duplicate numbers.
    *   "False" is returned if the input list is not sorted in ascending order or contains duplicate numbers.
