**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers and determine if it contains duplicate numbers. The process involves receiving a list of integers, checking for duplicates, and returning a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted and contains duplicates.

**Input Data:**
The input data required for this algorithm is a list of integers. This list can contain any type of integer, including whole numbers, decimals, and negative numbers.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive a List of Integers**: The algorithm starts by receiving a list of integers from the user or another source.
2. **Check for Duplicates**: The algorithm then checks if the list contains any duplicates. This is done by iterating through the list and comparing each element with every other element.
3. **Sort the List**: If the list contains duplicates, the algorithm sorts it in ascending order. This is done by iterating through the list and moving each element to its correct position based on its value.
4. **Return a Boolean Value**: After sorting the list, the algorithm returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted and contains duplicates. If the list is sorted and contains duplicates, the algorithm returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

**Expected Output:**
The expected output of this algorithm is a boolean value indicating whether the input list is sorted and contains duplicates. If the list is sorted and contains duplicates, the algorithm returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

**Implementation:**
The implementation of this algorithm can be done using a programming language such as Python or Java. The algorithm can be implemented using a loop that iterates through the list and checks for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, the algorithm sorts the list in ascending order and returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Here is a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def is_sorted_and_duplicates(lst):
    """
    Checks if a list of integers is sorted and contains duplicates.

    Args:
        lst (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is sorted and contains duplicates, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        return True

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    lst.sort()

    # Check for duplicates
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] == lst[i + 1]:
            return False

    return True

# Example usage:
lst = [5, 2, 8, 2
