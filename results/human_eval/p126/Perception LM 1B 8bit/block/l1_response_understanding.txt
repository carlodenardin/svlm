**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm checks if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It receives a list of integers as input and returns True if the list is sorted, False otherwise.

**Input Data:**
The algorithm requires a list of integers as input.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Input**: The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.
2. **Check if the list is sorted in ascending order**: The algorithm checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. If it is, the algorithm proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, it returns False.
3. **Check if the list has no more than one duplicate of the same number**: The algorithm checks if the list has no more than one duplicate of the same number. If it does, the algorithm returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
4. **Return True if both conditions are satisfied, False otherwise**: The algorithm returns True if both conditions are satisfied (the list is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number). Otherwise, it returns False.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns True if the list is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number, and False otherwise.
