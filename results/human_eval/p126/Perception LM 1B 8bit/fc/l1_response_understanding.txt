**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order and check if it has more than one duplicate of the same number. If it does, the algorithm returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

**Input Data:**
The input data required for this algorithm is a list of integers.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Start**: The algorithm begins by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, the algorithm returns False.
2. **Input a list of integers**: The algorithm then inputs the list of integers into the algorithm.
3. **Check if the list is sorted (ascending) and has no more than one duplicate of the same number**: The algorithm checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and if it has more than one duplicate of the same number. If both conditions are true, the algorithm returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
4. **Yes**: If the list is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number, the algorithm proceeds to the next step.
5. **True**: If the list is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number, the algorithm returns True.
6. **End**: If the list is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number, the algorithm returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm's expected output is True if the input list is sorted in ascending order and has no more than one duplicate of the same number, and False otherwise.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm can be implemented using a programming language such as Python or Java. The implementation would involve checking the input list for duplicates and sorting it in ascending order. The algorithm would then check if the sorted list has more than one duplicate of the same number. If both conditions are true, the algorithm would return False. Otherwise, it would return True.
