**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to check if a list of integers contains any numbers that appear more than twice. It iterates through the list, checking each number to see if it appears more than twice, and returns "True" if it does, "False" otherwise.

### Input Data
The algorithm requires a list of integers as input.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize the list and check if it's empty
```python
list = []
if not list:
    return False  # List is empty, return False
```

#### Step 2: Iterate through the list
```python
for num in list:
    # Check if the number appears more than twice
    if num appears more than twice:
        return True
```

#### Step 3: Return True or False
```python
return True if num appears more than twice, False otherwise
```

### Expected Output
The algorithm returns "True" if the list contains any numbers that appear more than twice, and "False" otherwise.

### Implementation
```python
def check_numbers_with_two appearances(list):
    """
    Checks if a list of integers contains any numbers that appear more than twice.

    Args:
        list (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the list contains any numbers that appear more than twice, False otherwise.
    """
    if not list:
        return False  # List is empty, return False

    for num in list:
        if num appears more than twice:
            return True  # Number appears more than twice, return True
        else:
            continue  # Number does not appear more than twice, continue to the next iteration

    return False  # List does not contain any numbers that appear more than twice
```
This implementation uses a simple iterative approach to check each number in the list, and returns "True" if any number appears more than twice, and "False" otherwise.
