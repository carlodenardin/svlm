**Algorithm Overview**
=======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to check if a list of integers contains any numbers that appear more than twice. It iterates through the list, checking each number to see if it appears more than twice, and returns "True" if it does, "False" otherwise.

### Input Data
*   The algorithm requires a list of integers as input.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize the List
*   The algorithm starts by initializing an empty list `l` to store the numbers to check.

#### Step 2: Iterate Through the List
*   The algorithm then iterates through the `l` list using a `for` loop.
*   For each number in the list, the algorithm checks if it appears more than twice by comparing it to the next number in the list.

#### Step 3: Decision Point
*   If the number appears more than twice, the algorithm returns "True".
*   If the number does not appear more than twice, the algorithm returns "False".

#### Step 4: End
*   After iterating through the entire list, the algorithm checks if the final result is "True" or "False".

### Expected Output
*   The algorithm returns "True" if the list contains any numbers that appear more than twice, and "False" otherwise.

### Implementation
```python
def check_numbers_with_two appearances(l):
    """
    Checks if a list of integers contains any numbers that appear more than twice.

    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the list contains any numbers that appear more than twice, False otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the numbers to check
    numbers_to_check = []

    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(len(l)):
        # Check if the current number appears more than twice
        if l[i] appears more than twice:
            # If it does, add it to the list
            numbers_to_check.append(l[i])

    # Check if the list contains any numbers that appear more than twice
    return l.count(numbers_to_check) > 1

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]
print(check_numbers_with_two appearances(numbers))  # Output: True
```
This implementation uses a simple iterative approach to check if the list contains any numbers that
