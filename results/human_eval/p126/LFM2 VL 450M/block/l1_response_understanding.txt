The algorithm's purpose is to verify if a given list of integers satisfies a specific condition, such as being divisible by a given number. The input data required is the list of integers to be checked. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of integers as input.
2. Check if the list is sorted in ascending order.
3. Check if the list has no more than one duplicate number.
4. Check if the list has the same number as the given number.
5. Return True if both conditions are satisfied, False otherwise.

The expected output is a boolean value indicating whether the list satisfies the condition or not.
