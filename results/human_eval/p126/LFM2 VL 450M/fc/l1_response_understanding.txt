The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of integers contains duplicate elements. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input a list of integers
3. Check if the list is sorted in ascending order and has no more than one duplicate element of the same number
4. If True, end
5. If False, continue to step 3
6. If True, end

The expected output is True if the list contains duplicate elements, and False otherwise.
