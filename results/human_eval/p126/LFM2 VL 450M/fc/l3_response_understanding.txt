The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of integers is equal to a specific integer value. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Initialize a variable 'i' to 1
3. Loop through the list of integers
4. If 'i' is equal to the given integer value, set 'i' to the given integer value
5. If 'i' is not equal to the given integer value, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 3
6. If 'i' is equal to 0, set 'i' to 0 and continue to step 3
7. If 'i' is not equal to 0, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 4
8. If 'i' is equal to 2, set 'i' to 2 and continue to step 4
9. If 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 5
10. If 'i' is equal to 1 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 6
11. If 'i' is equal to 1 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 7
12. If 'i' is equal to 2 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 8
13. If 'i' is equal to 1 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 9
14. If 'i' is equal to 2 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 10
15. If 'i' is equal to 1 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 11
16. If 'i' is equal to 2 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 12
17. If 'i' is equal to 1 and 'i' is not equal to 2, set 'i' to 1 and continue to step 13
