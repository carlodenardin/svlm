The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of numbers is smaller or equal to the next one. The input data required is a list of numbers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if the list is empty (No)
3. If the list is empty, end
4. If the list is not empty, check if the next number is smaller or equal to the current one (Yes)
5. If the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
6. If the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
7. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
8. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
9. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
10. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
11. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
12. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
13. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
14. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
15. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
16. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
17. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
18. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
19. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
20. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
21. If the list is not empty and the next number is smaller or equal to the current one, end
22. If the list is not empty and the next number is not smaller or equal to the current one, end
23. If the list is not empty and
