The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of numbers is smaller than the next one. The input data required is a list of numbers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. For each number in the list (list[int]):
   a. Check if the number is smaller than the next one (list[1]).
   b. If the number is smaller than the next one, end the loop.
   c. If the number is not smaller than the next one, end the loop.
   d. If the number is not smaller than the next one, check if there are any numbers that appear more than twice in the list.
   e. If there are any numbers that appear more than twice, end the loop.
   f. If there are no numbers that appear more than twice, end the loop.
   g. If there are no numbers that appear more than twice, end the loop.
   h. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   i. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   j. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   k. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   l. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   m. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   n. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   o. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   p. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   q. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   r. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   s. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   t. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   u. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   v. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   w. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice, end the loop.
   x. If the loop completes without any numbers appearing more than twice
