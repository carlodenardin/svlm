The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of integers is sorted in ascending or descending order. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if the list is empty or has only one element.
3. If the list is empty or has only one element, return "No" and "No" respectively.
4. If the list is sorted in ascending order, return "Yes" and "No" respectively.
5. If the list is sorted in descending order, return "Yes" and "No" respectively.
6. If the list is not sorted, return "No" and "No" respectively.

The expected output is "No" and "No" for the first two cases, and "Yes" and "No" for the remaining cases.
