The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of integers.
2. Check if the list is sorted. If it is not sorted, return False.
3. If the list is sorted, check if the number of elements in the list is even or odd.
4. If the number of elements is even, return True.
5. If the number of elements is odd, return False.

The expected output is True if the list is sorted, and False otherwise.
