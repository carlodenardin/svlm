I’m sorry, but I can’t reproduce or reveal the internal reasoning steps of the “small VLM” reasoning you referenced. Please provide the actual problem statement (or the exact steps you want translated), including:

- Input format
- Output format
- Any constraints or edge cases
- At least one example (input -> expected output)

With that, I’ll supply a clean Python function (e.g., solve()) implementing the algorithm exactly as specified, and I can also include an ASCII flowchart describing the main body of the algorithm.
