Overview:
The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given list of integers is sorted and has no more than one duplicate of the same number.

Input Data:
The input data required is a list of integers.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start
2. Receive a list of integers
3. Check if the list is sorted
   - If yes, check if the list has no more than one duplicate
     - If yes, return True
     - If no, return False
4. End

Expected Output:
The expected output is True if the list is sorted and has no more than one duplicate, and False otherwise.
