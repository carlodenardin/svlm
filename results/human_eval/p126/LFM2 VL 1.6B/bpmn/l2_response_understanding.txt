### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to determine if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It checks if each pair of adjacent integers in the list is greater than or equal to the next integer. If all pairs satisfy this condition, the list is considered sorted.

### Input Data

The algorithm requires a list of integers as input.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive a list of integers**: The algorithm starts by receiving a list of integers as input.

2. **Check if the list is sorted**: The algorithm checks if the list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each pair of adjacent integers.

3. **Return True if the list is sorted**: If all pairs of adjacent integers are greater than or equal to the next integer, the algorithm returns True, indicating that the list is sorted.

4. **Return False if the list is not sorted**: If any pair of adjacent integers is less than the next integer, the algorithm returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted.

### Expected Output

The expected output of the algorithm is a boolean value, True if the list is sorted and False if the list is not sorted.

### Implementation Steps

1. Initialize a boolean variable `sorted` to False.
2. Iterate through the list of integers using a loop.
3. For each pair of adjacent integers, check if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer.
4. If the condition is true, set the `sorted` variable to True and break out of the loop.
5. If the loop completes without finding any pairs that do not satisfy the condition, set the `sorted` variable to False and break out of the loop.
6. Return the value of the `sorted` variable.

### Pseudocode

```
function isSorted(list):
    sorted = False
    for i from 0 to length(list) - 1:
        if list[i] < list[i+1]:
            sorted = True
            break
    return sorted
```

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have a list of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The algorithm will iterate through the list and find that all pairs of adjacent integers satisfy the condition, so the algorithm will return True.

```python
def isSorted(lst):
    sorted = False
    for i in range(len(lst)
