Overview:
The algorithm is designed to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division of the two numbers until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Input Data:
The algorithm requires two integers as input.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize i to 0.
2. While i is less than the length of the list of integers:
   a. If the current number in the list is less than the current number in the list:
      - Increment i by 1.
   b. If the current number in the list is greater than or equal to the current number in the list:
      - Return False.
3. If the loop completes without returning False:
   - Return True.

Expected Output:
The algorithm returns True if the two integers have a common divisor, and False otherwise.
