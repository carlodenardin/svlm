Overview:
The algorithm is designed to check if a given list of integers contains duplicate numbers. It iterates through the list, comparing each number with the previous ones to determine if there are any duplicates.

Input Data:
The algorithm requires a list of integers as input.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start: Begin the algorithm.
2. For each number in the list:
   a. Check if the number is smaller than the next number.
   b. If yes, continue to the next number.
   c. If no, check if the number is smaller than the previous number.
   d. If yes, there is a duplicate, so mark the number as found and break out of the loop.
   e. If no, mark the number as not found and continue to the next number.
3. If no duplicates are found, mark the list as not containing duplicates and end the algorithm.

Expected Output:
The algorithm outputs "True" if the list contains duplicates, and "False" if it does not.

Implementation:
```python
def contains_duplicates(numbers):
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] < numbers[i + 1]:
            return True
    return False
```
