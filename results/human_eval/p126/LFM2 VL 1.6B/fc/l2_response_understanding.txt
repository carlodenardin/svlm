### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to filter a list of integers based on a specific condition. It checks each number in the list to determine if it meets a certain criterion. If the criterion is met, the number is included in the output list. If not, the number is excluded.

### Input Data

The algorithm requires a list of integers as input. This list can be of any size and can contain both positive and negative integers.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Start**: The algorithm begins.
2. **Input List**: The algorithm receives a list of integers as input.
3. **Check Each Number**: For each number in the list, the algorithm checks if it meets the specified condition.
4. **Condition Check**: The algorithm checks if the number is smaller or equal than the next number in the list.
5. **Yes**: If the condition is met, the algorithm includes the number in the output list.
6. **No**: If the condition is not met, the algorithm excludes the number from the output list.
7. **End**: The algorithm ends.

### Expected Output

The expected output is a new list containing only the numbers that meet the specified condition. If no numbers meet the condition, the output list will be empty.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize an empty output list**: This will store the numbers that meet the condition.
2. **Loop through each number in the input list**: For each number, perform the condition check.
3. **If condition is met**: Add the number to the output list.
4. **End of input list reached**: Stop the loop and return the output list.

### Pseudocode

```
function filterList(inputList):
    outputList = []
    for i = 0 to length(inputList) - 1:
        if inputList[i] <= inputList[i+1]:
            outputList.append(inputList[i])
    return outputList
```

### Example

**Input List**: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3]

**Condition**: Check if a number is smaller or equal than the next number.

**Output List**: [5, 2, 1, 3]

**Explanation**: The numbers 5, 2, 1, and 3 are smaller or equal than the next number in the list, so they are included
