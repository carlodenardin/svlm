Overview:
The algorithm is designed to check if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It takes a list of integers as input and returns "True" if the list is sorted, and "False" otherwise.

Input Data:
The input data required for this algorithm is a list of integers.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start: The algorithm begins.
2. Input a list of integers: The user provides a list of integers as input.
3. Check if the list is sorted (ascending): The algorithm checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. It does this by comparing each element in the list with the next element. If any pair of elements is out of order, the algorithm returns "False".
4. Yes: If the list is sorted, the algorithm proceeds to the next step.
5. True: If the list is sorted, the algorithm returns "True".
6. End: The algorithm ends.

Expected Output:
The expected output of this algorithm is either "True" or "False", depending on whether the input list is sorted in ascending order or not.
