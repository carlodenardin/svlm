### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to determine whether a given integer `i` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The algorithm uses a series of logical checks to determine if `i` is prime.

### Input Data

The algorithm requires a single input, which is an integer `i`.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Start**: The algorithm begins.
2. **Input i**: The integer `i` is input.
3. **List i**: The algorithm checks if `i` is less than or equal to 1. If `i` is less than or equal to 1, the algorithm immediately returns `False`, indicating that `i` is not a prime number.
4. **List i**: If `i` is greater than 1, the algorithm proceeds to the next step.
5. **List i**: The algorithm checks if `i` is divisible by any integer from 2 to `i-1`. If `i` is divisible by any of these integers, the algorithm returns `False`, indicating that `i` is not a prime number.
6. **List i**: If `i` is not divisible by any integer from 2 to `i-1`, the algorithm checks if `i` is divisible by `i+1`. If `i` is divisible by `i+1`, the algorithm returns `False`, indicating that `i` is not a prime number.
7. **List i**: If `i` is not divisible by any integer from 2 to `i-1` or `i+1`, the algorithm checks if `i` is divisible by `i+2`. If `i` is divisible by `i+2`, the algorithm returns `False`, indicating that `i` is not a prime number.
8. **End**: If none of the above conditions are met, the algorithm returns `True`, indicating that `i` is a prime number.

### Expected Output

The algorithm returns `True` if `i` is a prime number and `False` otherwise.

### Example

Suppose the input is `i = 7`. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. `i` is greater than 1, so the algorithm checks if `i` is divisible by any integer from 2 to `
