    """
    Implements the described flowchart:
    - Initialize a counter 'count' for distinct numbers encountered.
    - Maintain a set 'counted' of numbers already counted.
    - Iterate through 'nums':
        - If the number has not been counted yet, mark it as counted and increment 'count'.
        - If 'count' is greater than 2, print the current number and its current count,
          and record the pair in the results list.
    - Return the list of (number, count) pairs that were printed.
    Input:
        nums: iterable of numbers
    Output:
        list of tuples (num, count) corresponding to each print event
