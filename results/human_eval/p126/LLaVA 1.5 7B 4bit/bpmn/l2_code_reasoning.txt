    Implements the described flowchart-inspired algorithm:
    - Sort the input list of integers in ascending order.
    - If the list has more than two elements, iterate once over the sorted list,
      comparing the current and previous item, and return either the previous
      or the current integer wrapped in a single-element list according to
      the described conditions.
    - If the list has two or fewer elements, return the full sorted list.
