The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to verify if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and contains no duplicate numbers. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: Receive a list of integers as input. This data will be used for further processing to determine its properties.
2. **Sorting Check**: Verify whether the received list is sorted in ascending order. If not, proceed with identifying duplicates.
3. **Duplicate Check**: Ensure that there are no more than one occurrence of each number within the list. This involves iterating through the list and comparing adjacent elements.
4. **Condition Verification**: Return `True` only if both conditions (sorted in ascending order and without duplicates) are satisfied. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Accept the list of integers from the user or any other source.
   
2. **Sorting Validation**:
   - Implement a function to sort the list in ascending order using built-in sorting algorithms like `sort()` in Python or equivalent methods in other programming languages.
   - Compare the original list with the sorted version to check for equality.

3. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Use nested loops or efficient searching techniques (e.g., hash sets) to identify repeated values within the list.
   - Count occurrences of each element; ensure it does not exceed one per element.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After confirming both conditions are met, output `True`.
   - If either condition fails, output `False`.

This structured approach ensures accurate validation of the integer list's characteristics.
