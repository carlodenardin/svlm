The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to check if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: Receive a list of integers as input. This will be stored in a variable, say `input_list`.

2. **Sorting Check**: Verify whether the list is sorted in ascending order. This can be done using Python's built-in `sorted()` function or by manually iterating through the list and comparing adjacent elements. If the list is found to be sorted, proceed to the next step; otherwise, return `False` immediately.

3. **Duplicate Check**: Ensure that there are no duplicates within the list. This involves checking each element against all subsequent elements to see if any match. For efficiency, sort the list first (as seen previously) and then iterate through it with two pointers to compare elements without needing nested loops for every pair. If a duplicate is detected, return `False` immediately.

4. **Output**: Return `True` only if both conditions—sorted in ascending order and no duplicates—are satisfied. Otherwise, return `False`.

This logical flow ensures that the algorithm efficiently identifies valid sorted lists while avoiding unnecessary computations.
