The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to determine whether a list of integers forms an arithmetic progression. Here's a step-by-step implementation description:

### Overview:
The purpose of this algorithm is to check if a given list of integers is an arithmetic progression, meaning that the difference between consecutive elements remains constant throughout the sequence.

### Input Data:
- A list of integers named `list`.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receive List of Integers**: Start by receiving the input list of integers.
2. **Initialize Index**: Initialize a counter variable `i` to 1. This will be used to iterate through the list starting from the second element.
3. **Check Length Condition**: Compare the current index `i` with the length of the list. If `i` is less than the length of the list, proceed to the next decision point. Otherwise, return `True` as the list can potentially form an arithmetic progression (since there might not be enough elements for comparison).
4. **Compare Subsequent Elements**: Check if the value at the current index `i` is equal to the previous element (`list[i]`) minus one (`list[i - 1]`). If they are equal, it indicates no change occurred between these two elements, which contradicts the definition of an arithmetic progression. Return `False` in this case.
5. **Check Further Conditions**: If the above condition fails, verify if both the current index and its preceding indices meet specific conditions:
   - Ensure `i > 1` indicating more than just the first element.
   - Confirm that the differences between subsequent pairs of elements (`list[i]` and `list[i - 1]`) are equal to each other (`list[i - 1]` and `list[i - 2]`). If true, return `False` because the common difference changes.
6. **Increment Index**: Increase the index `i` by 1 to move to the next pair of elements for further comparison.
7. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 3 to 6 until either all comparisons confirm the presence of a consistent common difference or sufficient iterations have been made without finding such a pattern.

### Expected Output:
- The algorithm returns `True` if the list forms an arithmetic progression.
- It returns `False` otherwise.

This structured approach ensures thorough verification of the arithmetic progression property across the entire list of integers.
