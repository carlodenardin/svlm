The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to determine if a list of integers is sorted. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Receive Input**: The process begins by receiving a list of integers as input.
2. **Initial Check**: 
   - Determine if the list is already sorted.
   - If not, proceed to check for duplicates in the list.
3. **Sorted Check**:
   - Iterate through the list and compare each element with its subsequent one.
   - If any pair of consecutive elements are found to be unequal (indicating they are not in ascending order), return `False` indicating the list is not sorted.
4. **Duplicate Check**:
   - Use a loop or a set to identify numbers that appear more than twice.
   - If such occurrences are detected, also return `False`.
5. **Return True**:
   - If both conditions fail (i.e., no duplicates greater than twice and the list is properly sorted), conclude that the list is sorted and return `True`.

**Expected Output**:
- The output will either be `True` if the list is sorted without duplicate values exceeding two times, or `False` otherwise.

This structured approach ensures thorough validation of the integer list's sorting status and uniqueness.
