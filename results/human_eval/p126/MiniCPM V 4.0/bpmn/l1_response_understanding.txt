The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to check whether a list of integers is sorted without any duplicate numbers. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input Data**: The algorithm requires a list of integers as input. This data will be processed to determine if it meets the specified criteria.

2. **Initialization**: Begin by receiving the list of integers and setting up any necessary variables or structures for further processing.

3. **Main Logical Flow**:
   - **Decision Point 1**: Check if the current integer being examined is different from the previous one in the sequence. If not, proceed with the next element.
   - **Loop**: Continue examining each subsequent integer in the list until you reach the end.
   - **Decision Point 2**: After checking all elements, verify if there are any duplicates within the list. Ensure that no number repeats more than once.
   - **Conditional Checks**: Based on the results of these checks:
     - If the list passes both conditions (sorted and unique), output "Give back True".
     - If either condition fails, output "Give back False".

4. **Expected Output**: The final result indicates whether the provided list of integers satisfies the sorting and uniqueness requirements. Specifically, it outputs either "True" if the list is valid or "False" otherwise.

This process ensures thorough validation of the given list against the defined criteria, providing clear feedback based on its compliance.
