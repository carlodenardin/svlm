The purpose of this algorithm is to determine whether a given list of integers is sorted and contains no duplicate numbers. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input Data**: Receive a list of integers as input.
2. **Initial Check**: Verify if the received data is indeed a list of integers. Ensure it's not empty or null.
3. **Sorting and Uniqueness Check**: 
   - Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
   - Iterate through the sorted list starting from the second element.
   - For each element, check if it matches the previous one. If they do not match, confirm that there are no duplicates by comparing with subsequent elements.
4. **Decision Point**:
   - If all elements are unique after sorting, output "Give back True" indicating the list is sorted without duplicates.
   - If any element finds a duplicate during iteration, output "Give back False" indicating the presence of duplicates.
5. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until either uniqueness is confirmed or a duplicate is found.

This process ensures the integrity of the list while providing clear feedback on its condition.
