The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to find and print all elements that are duplicates within a given list of integers. Here's a step-by-step implementation based on the logical flow:

### Algorithm Overview
The purpose of this algorithm is to identify duplicate elements within a provided integer list and output them.

### Input Data
- **Input**: A list of integers (`list[int]`).

### Main Logical Flow
1. Initialize an index variable `i` to 1.
2. Enter a loop where the condition checks if `i` is less than the length of the list (`i < len(l)`).
   - If true, proceed with further comparisons.
   - If false, exit the loop as there are no more indices to check.
3. Within the loop, compare the current element at index `i` with the previous element at index `i-1`.
   - If they are equal, it indicates a duplicate exists between these positions. Print or handle the duplicate accordingly.
4. Increment the index by 1 (`i = i + 1`) and repeat steps 2-3 until all elements have been checked.
5. After checking all elements, ensure there are still remaining elements greater than 1 (i.e., not just adjacent pairs) before concluding.
6. If any additional conditions for uniqueness aren't met, end the process.

### Expected Output
The expected output includes all duplicate values found within the input list. These duplicates should be printed out sequentially once identified during the iteration through the list.

This structured approach ensures thorough examination of the list for duplicates while efficiently handling potential edge cases involving repeated sequences.
