The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to check if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order and contains no more than one duplicate of the same number. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Input Data**: An input list of integers is provided as the data required for processing.
3. **Check Sorted and Unique**: 
   - Verify whether the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - Ensure there are no more than one duplicate of any integer within the list.
4. **Decision Point**: Based on the results from the previous checks, make a decision:
   - If both conditions (sorted and unique) are satisfied, proceed with the "True" path.
   - If either condition fails, follow the "False" path.
5. **Output**:
   - If true, output that the list meets the criteria (sorted and has only one duplicate).
   - If false, conclude without further action since the list does not meet the requirements.

This logical structure ensures efficient validation of the list against specified criteria, providing clear outcomes based on the initial input.
