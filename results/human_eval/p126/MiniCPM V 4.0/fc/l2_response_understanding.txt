The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to check if a list of integers contains any duplicate numbers. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step process for its implementation:

1. **Start**: Begin with an empty or predefined integer list `I`.
2. **Input Data**: The input data required is a list of integers, denoted as `list[int]`.
3. **Main Logical Flow**:
   - Iterate through each number in the list and compare it with the next one.
   - If a number is found smaller than or equal to the next number, proceed to the next decision point.
   - Check if there are any numbers that appear more than twice in the list.
     - If such duplicates exist, output "False" indicating the presence of duplicates.
     - If no duplicates are found, continue checking subsequent pairs until all have been compared.
4. **Decision Points**:
   - If a pair of consecutive numbers is not less than or equal to each other, end the loop early (No).
   - If no duplicates are detected after comparing all possible pairs, conclude successfully without duplicates (True).
5. **Output**: 
   - If no duplicates are present, the expected output is "End", signifying successful verification of unique elements in the list.

This systematic approach ensures thorough examination of the list to identify any occurrences of repeated values efficiently.
