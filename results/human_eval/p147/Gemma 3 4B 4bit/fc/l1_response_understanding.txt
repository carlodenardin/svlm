Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm aims to count the number of distinct pairs of elements within a given vector (array) of integers.  It's essentially a pair counting problem, but with a specific constraint â€“ it needs to find *distinct* pairs.

**2. Input Data**

*   **n:** An integer representing the size (number of elements) of the vector.
*   **vector:** A vector (array) of integers, indexed from 0 to n-1.  The elements within the vector are the input data.

**3. Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Receive the input `n` (size of the vector) and the `vector`.
    *   Create a hash set (or dictionary) called `seen_pairs`. This will store the pairs of elements that have already been counted.  This is crucial for ensuring we only count distinct pairs.

2.  **Vector Initialization:**
    *   Create a vector of size `n`.
    *   Initialize each element of the vector with a value based on the formula: `|x| + y + t` where `t` is the index of the element (i.e., `t = i`).  This formula is provided in the flowchart.

3.  **Iteration and Pair Counting:**
    *   Loop through the vector from index `i = 0` to `n - 1`.
    *   For each element at index `i`, let's call it `x`.
    *   Loop through the vector from index `j = i + 1` to `n - 1`.
    *   For each element at index `j`, let's call it `y`.
    *   Create a pair `(x, y)`.
    *   Check if the pair `(x, y)` has already been seen (i.e., is present in the `seen_pairs` hash set).
        *   If the pair is *not* in `seen_pairs`:
            *   Add the pair `(x, y)` to the `seen_pairs` hash set.
            *   Increment the `count` variable (initialized to 0).
        *   If the pair *is* in `seen_pairs`:
