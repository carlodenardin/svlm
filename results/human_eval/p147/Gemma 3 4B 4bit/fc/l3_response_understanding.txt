Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This flowchart describes an algorithm to count the number of distinct characters in a given string.  It's essentially a character frequency counter.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **`n`:** An integer representing the length of the string.
*   **`a`:** A string (or array) containing the characters of the input string.  It's initialized to `a[0]`.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `n` is set to the length of the string `a`.
    *   `i` is initialized to 1.
    *   `count` is initialized to 0.
    *   `a` is initialized to `a[0]`.

2.  **Outer Loop (Character Iteration):**
    *   The `while i <= n` loop iterates through each character of the string `a`.

3.  **Inner Loop (Character Comparison):**
    *   `j` is initialized to 1.
    *   The `while j <= len(a)` loop iterates through the string `a` again, comparing each character with the current character `a[i-1]`.

4.  **Comparison and Increment:**
    *   Inside the inner loop:
        *   `j` is incremented.
        *   `k` is incremented.
        *   The `while k < len(a)` loop compares `a[j-1]` with `a[k-1]`.
        *   If `a[j-1]` is different from `a[k-1]`, the `count` is incremented to 1.

5.  **Termination:**
    *   The outer loop continues until `i` exceeds the length of the string `a`.
    *   The inner loop continues until `j` exceeds the length of the string `a`.

6.  **Output:**
    *   The algorithm returns the final value of `count`, which represents the number of distinct characters in the string.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return an integer representing the number of distinct characters present in the input string `a`.

**In essence
