Okay, let's break down the algorithm described in the flowchart and outline its implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to generate a list of integers based on a specific rule and then determine the number of distinct triples within that list whose sum is a multiple of 3.  Essentially, it's a combination of list generation and a numerical analysis task.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Integer `n`:** This is the primary input. It defines the dimension of the list to be created.  `n` represents the number of elements in the list.

**3. Algorithm Implementation - Step-by-Step**

1.  **Receive Input:**
    *   The algorithm begins by receiving an integer `n` as input.

2.  **Create List:**
    *   Create an empty list (e.g., `my_list = []`).
    *   Iterate from `i = 1` to `n` (inclusive).
    *   For each `i`, calculate `A[i] = i + 1` and append this value to `my_list`.

3.  **Populate List:**
    *   The list is populated according to the rule: `A[i] = i + 1`.  This means the list will contain the integers from 1 to `n`.

4.  **Calculate Triples and Sums:**
    *   Initialize a set called `distinct_sums` to store the distinct sums of triples.  Sets are used to ensure uniqueness.
    *   Iterate through the list `my_list` using a nested loop structure.  Specifically, we'll iterate through all possible triples (combinations of three elements) from the list.
    *   For each triple (i, j, k) where `1 <= i < j < k <= n`:
        *   Calculate the sum of the triple: `sum_triple = my_list[i] + my_list[j] + my_list[k]`
        *   Check if `sum_triple` is divisible by 3 (i.e., `sum_triple % 3 == 0`).
        *   If it is, add `sum_triple` to the `distinct_sums` set.

5.  **Count Distinct Sums:**
    *   After iterating through all possible triples, the
