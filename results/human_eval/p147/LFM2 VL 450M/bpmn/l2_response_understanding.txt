The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the sum of the elements in a given array. The input data required is the array of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `a` in the array.
3. If `a` is equal to 1, increment `sum` by 1.
4. If `a` is equal to 0, set `sum` to 0.
5. Iterate through each element `a` in the array.
6. If `a` is equal to 1, increment `sum` by `a`.
7. If `a` is equal to 0, set `sum` to `sum + a`.
8. Return the final value of `sum`.

The expected output is the sum of all elements in the array.
