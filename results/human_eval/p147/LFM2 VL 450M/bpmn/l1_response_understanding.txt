The algorithm's purpose is to initialize a vector of dimensions with a given rule, and then return the sum of the distinct triplets of elements in the vector.

Input data required: The input data required is the vector of dimensions with a given rule.

Main logical flow:

1. Initialize a vector of dimensions with a given rule.
2. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the distinct triplets.
3. Iterate through each element in the vector.
4. For each element, check if it satisfies the rule.
5. If the element satisfies the rule, add it to the sum of the distinct triplets.
6. Return the sum of the distinct triplets.

Expected output: The output of the algorithm is the sum of the distinct triplets of elements in the vector.
