The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the value of a given integer n by repeatedly dividing it by 2 until it becomes 1. The input data required is the integer n. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `counter` to 0.
2. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
3. While `counter` is less than or equal to n:
   a. Divide `counter` by 2.
   b. If `result` is 0, return `counter` as the result.
   c. If `result` is not 0, increment `counter` by 1.
   d. If `counter` is not 1, increment `result` by 1.
   e. If `counter` is not 1, increment `result` by 1.
   f. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   g. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   h. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   i. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   j. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   k. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   l. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   m. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   n. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   o. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   p. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   r. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   s. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   t. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   u. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   v. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by 1.
   w. If `counter` is not 1, increment `counter` by
