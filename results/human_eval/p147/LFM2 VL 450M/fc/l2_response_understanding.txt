The algorithm's purpose is to create a vector of dimension and initialize the values of a rule that will be used to determine whether a given number is equal to a certain value. The input data required is the starting number 'n', and the main logical flow is as follows:

1. Create a vector of dimension and initialize the values of a rule that will be used to determine whether a given number is equal to a certain value.
2. Iterate over each triple of a 'a' and 'b' with 'k' as the number to be compared.
3. For each triple, check if 'a' is equal to 'b' and 'a' is equal to 'k'.
4. If 'a' is equal to 'b' and 'a' is equal to 'k', then count the number of triplets.
5. If 'a' is equal to 'k', then count the number of triplets.
6. If 'a' is not equal to 'k', then count the number of triplets.

The expected output is the count of triplets that satisfy the condition 'a' is equal to 'k'.
