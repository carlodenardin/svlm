The algorithm's purpose is to count the number of distinct triangles in an image. The input data required is an image of a flowchart. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Create a vector of dimension n and initialize the values of n.
3. Initialize the values of n.
4. Count how many distinct triangles of a are counted.
5. End

The expected output is the count of distinct triangles in the image.
