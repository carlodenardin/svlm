### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to calculate the number of distinct triplets of integers (A, B, C) such that their sum is a multiple of 3. This is a common problem in combinatorics and number theory, often used in various mathematical and computational contexts.

### Input Data

- **Input:** A list of integers `A` of length `n`.
- **Constraints:** The list `A` contains distinct integers.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Initialize a Vector of Dimension n:**
   - Create a vector `A` of size `n` to store the integers.

2. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a counter `count` to zero. This will keep track of the number of valid triplets.

3. **Iterate Over All Possible Triplets:**
   - For each integer `A[i]` in the vector `A`:
     - For each integer `A[j]` in the vector `A` starting from `i+1` to `n-1`:
       - For each integer `A[k]` in the vector `A` starting from `i+1` to `n-1`:
         - Calculate the sum `sum = A[i] + A[j] + A[k]`.
         - Check if `sum % 3 == 0`.
         - If the condition is true, increment the counter `count`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through all possible triplets, return the value of `count`.

### Expected Output

- The output is the number of distinct triplets `A[i]`, `B[i]`, and `C[i]` such that their sum is a multiple of 3.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
function countTriplets(A):
    n = length(A)
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            for k in range(i+1, n):
                sum = A[i] + A[j] + A[k]
                if sum % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** The vector `A` is initialized with the given list of integers.
- **Nested Loops:** The three nested loops iterate over all possible combinations of three distinct
