Algorithm: Counting Fibonacci Numbers

Overview:
The algorithm is designed to count the number of Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and count the numbers that are less than or equal to the given limit.

Input Data:
- limit: The maximum number to consider in the Fibonacci sequence.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Start the algorithm.
2. Initialize a variable count to 0.
3. While the current number is less than or equal to the limit:
   a. Increment the count by 1.
   b. Calculate the next Fibonacci number using the formula: fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).
   c. Check if the next Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the limit.
   d. If the next Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the limit, increment the count by 1.
   e. Otherwise, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
4. End the algorithm.

Expected Output:
- The count of Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to the given limit.

Implementation:
```python
def count_fibonacci(limit):
    count = 0
    while limit >= 0:
        count += 1
        fibonacci_number = fibonacci_number_function(limit)
        if fibonacci_number <= limit:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    return count

def fibonacci_number_function(limit):
    if limit == 0:
        return 0
    elif limit == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci_number_function(limit-1) + fibonacci_number_function(limit-2)
```
