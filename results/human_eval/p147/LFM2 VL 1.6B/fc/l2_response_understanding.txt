Overview:
The algorithm is designed to count the number of distinct triplets in a vector of dimension n. It iterates over each triple of elements in the vector, checks if they are distinct, and increments a counter if they are.

Input Data:
The input data required is a vector of n integers, denoted as A = [a1, a2,..., an], where 1 ≤ i ≤ n and a_i ∈ ℝ.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Iterate over each triple (a1, a2, a3) in the vector A.
3. Check if the triple (a1, a2, a3) is distinct by comparing it with all other triplets in A.
4. If the triple is distinct, increment the counter by 1.
5. After iterating over all triplets, return the counter value.

Expected Output:
The expected output is the count of distinct triplets in the vector A.
