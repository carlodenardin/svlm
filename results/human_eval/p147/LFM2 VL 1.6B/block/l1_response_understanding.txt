### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm described is designed to process a list of integers based on a specific rule. The rule involves creating a list of distinct triples from the input list, where each triple consists of three integers. The algorithm takes an integer as input and returns the number of distinct triples that can be formed from the list.

### Input Data

- **Input**: A list of integers, `input_list`.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Initialize a Set for Distinct Triples**:
   - Create an empty set called `distinct_triples` to store unique triples.

2. **Iterate Over Each Integer in the List**:
   - For each integer `num` in `input_list`:
     - **Check for Distinct Triples**:
       - For each integer `num1` in `input_list`:
         - For each integer `num2` in `input_list`:
           - For each integer `num3` in `input_list`:
               - Check if `(num1, num2, num3)` is not already in `distinct_triples`:
                 - If not, add `(num1, num2, num3)` to `distinct_triples`.

3. **Count Distinct Triples**:
   - After iterating through all integers, the size of `distinct_triples` will give the count of distinct triples.

### Expected Output

- **Output**: The number of distinct triples that can be formed from the input list.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
function countDistinctTriples(input_list):
    distinct_triples = set()
    
    for num1 in input_list:
        for num2 in input_list:
            for num3 in input_list:
                if (num1, num2, num3) not in distinct_triples:
                    distinct_triples.add((num1, num2, num3))
    
    return len(distinct_triples)
```

### Explanation

- **Set for Distinct Triples**: Using a set ensures that each triple is stored only once, even if it appears multiple times in the input list.
- **Triple Generation**: The triple `(num1, num2, num3)` is generated by iterating over all combinations of three integers from the input list.
- **Efficiency**
