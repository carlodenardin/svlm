**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to generate a list of distinct triples from a given input integer. It takes an integer as input and returns the list of triples that meet the specified rule.

**Input Data:**
The input data required for the algorithm is an integer, which serves as the starting point for generating the list of triples.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive an integer as input**: The algorithm receives an integer as input.
2. **Create a list of dimension n**: The algorithm creates a list of dimension n, which will be used to generate the list of triples.
3. **Populate the list with this rule**: The algorithm populates the list with the rule A[i-1] = i*i-i+1, where 1 <= i <= n. This rule generates the list of triples based on the input integer.
4. **Return how many sum of distinct triples of the list are multiple of 3**: The algorithm returns the number of distinct triples in the list that are multiples of 3.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm's expected output is the number of distinct triples in the list that are multiples of 3.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm's implementation can be achieved using a programming language such as Python or Java. The code would involve the following steps:

*   Initialize an empty list to store the triples.
*   Iterate over the range of the input integer (1 to n).
*   For each iteration, calculate the value of A[i-1] using the given rule.
*   Check if the calculated value is a multiple of 3. If it is, add the triple to the list.
*   Return the total number of triples that are multiples of 3.

Here is a simple Python implementation of the algorithm:

```python
def generate_triples(n):
    """
    Generate a list of triples that are multiples of 3.

    Args:
        n (int): The input integer.

    Returns:
        list: A list of triples that are multiples of 3.
    """
    triples = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i * i - i + 1 % 3 == 0:
            triples.append((i, i * i - i + 1, i))
    return triples

# Example usage:
n = 5
triples = generate_triples(n)
print(triples)
```

This implementation generates a list of triples that are multiples of 3 and returns
