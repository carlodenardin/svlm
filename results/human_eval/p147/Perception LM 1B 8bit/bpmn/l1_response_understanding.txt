**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the number of distinct triples of A that are multiples of 3, given an integer input. It initializes a vector of dimension n with a specific rule and then returns the count of such triples.

**Input Data:**
- The input is an integer, which serves as the dimension of the vector A.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm initializes a vector of dimension n with the rule A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1, where 1 <= i <= n. This step sets up the initial conditions for the vector A.

2. **Input Processing**: The algorithm receives an integer input, which is used to initialize the vector A.

3. **Vector Initialization**: The algorithm initializes the vector A with the given rule. This step ensures that the vector is populated according to the specified rule.

4. **Output Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the number of distinct triples of A that are multiples of 3. This involves iterating through the vector A and checking each element to see if it is a multiple of 3.

5. **Result Return**: The algorithm returns the count of distinct triples of A that are multiples of 3.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm expects to return the number of distinct triples of A that are multiples of 3, given the input integer.

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_triples(n):
    # Initialize vector A with the given rule
    A = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]

    # Calculate the number of distinct triples of A that are multiples of 3
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if A[i - 1] % 3 == 0:
            count += 1

    return count

# Example usage
n = 5
result = calculate_triples(n)
print(f"The number of distinct triples of A that are multiples of 3 is: {result}")
```

This implementation follows the outlined algorithm, providing a clear and concise description of the process.
