**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to generate a sequence of integers based on a given input integer `n`. It initializes a vector of dimension `n` with a specific rule and then iterates over each triple of the vector, incrementing a counter by 1 if the sum of the triple is a multiple of 3.

### Input Data
* Input: An integer `n`

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize a Vector
* Initialize a vector `A` of dimension `n` with the rule `A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1` where `1 <= i <= n`.
* This rule generates a sequence of integers based on the input `n`.

#### Step 2: Initialize a Counter
* Initialize a counter `c` equal to 0.

#### Step 3: Iterate Over Each Triple
* Iterate over each triple `(i, j, k)` in the vector `A` where `1 <= i <= n`, `1 <= j <= n`, and `1 <= k <= n`.
* For each triple, increment the counter `c` by 1 if the sum of the triple `(i, j, k)` is a multiple of 3.

#### Step 4: Return the Counter
* Return the final value of the counter `c`.

### Expected Output
* The algorithm generates a sequence of integers based on the input `n`, with each integer being a multiple of 3 if the sum of its triple is a multiple of 3.

### Code Implementation
```python
def generate_sequence(n):
    # Initialize vector A
    A = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]

    # Initialize counter
    c = 0

    # Iterate over each triple in A
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n):
            for k in range(1, n):
                # Check if the sum of the triple is a multiple of 3
                if (i + j + k) % 3 == 0:
                    c += 1

    return c

# Example usage
n = 5
print(generate_sequence(n))
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's logical flow and provides a clear understanding of how the algorithm works.
