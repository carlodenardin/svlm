**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose

The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of all elements in a given array. It iterates through the array, performing a specific operation on each element and accumulating the results.

### Input Data

*   The input data is an array of integers, where each element represents the value of an element in the array.
*   The array is represented as a list or array in the programming language.

### Main Logical Flow

#### Step 1: Initialize Variables

*   `n`: The number of elements in the array.
*   `i`: The current index of the current element.
*   `a`: The current element being processed.
*   `count`: A counter variable to keep track of the sum of the elements.

#### Step 2: Process Each Element

*   For each element `a[i]` in the array:
    *   Calculate the sum of all elements in the array using the formula `sum = a[i-1] + a[i]`.
    *   Update the `count` variable by adding the sum of all elements in the array.
    *   Increment the `i` variable to move to the next element in the array.

#### Step 3: Handle Edge Cases

*   If the current index `i` is less than the length of the array `len(a)`, it means the end of the array has been reached, and the algorithm returns without processing any more elements.
*   If the current index `i` is greater than the length of the array `len(a)`, it means the end of the array has been reached, and the algorithm returns without processing any more elements.

#### Step 4: Return the Sum

*   After processing all elements in the array, the algorithm returns the sum of all elements in the array.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have the following array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
*   The algorithm will iterate through the array, calculating the sum of each element and accumulating the results.
*   The final sum will be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`.

### Code Implementation

```python
def calculate_sum(arr):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all elements in a given array.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all elements in the array.
    """
    n = len(arr)
