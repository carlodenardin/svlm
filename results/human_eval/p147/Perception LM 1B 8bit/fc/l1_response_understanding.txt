**Algorithm Overview: Counting Distinct Triples of a Number**
===========================================================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to count the number of distinct triples of a given number `n`. It initializes a vector `A` with `n` elements and then iterates through each element to check if it is a distinct triple of a number. If it is, the algorithm increments the count.

### Input Data
* `n`: The input number for which the algorithm is designed.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialize the Vector `A`
```python
A = [0] * n
```
#### Step 2: Iterate Through Each Element in `A`
```python
for i in range(n):
    # Check if the current element is a distinct triple of a number
    if A[i] == i * i - i + 1:
        count += 1
```
#### Step 3: Return the Count
```python
return count
```
### Expected Output
The algorithm returns the count of distinct triples of the input number `n`.

### Implementation
```python
def count_distinct_triples(n):
    A = [0] * n
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if A[i] == i * i - i + 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This implementation takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of distinct triples of `n`.
