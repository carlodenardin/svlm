The flowchart represents an algorithm for calculating the factorial of a given number \( n \).

### Purpose:
The purpose of this algorithm is to compute and return the factorial of a positive integer \( n \). The factorial of \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Input Data:
- An integer \( n \) representing the input number whose factorial needs to be calculated.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: Begin the process.
2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set \( i \) to 1.
   - Create an array `a` with length equal to \( n \) filled with zeros.
3. **Check Condition**:
   - While \( i \leq n \):
     - Calculate \( a[i-1] = i \times (i-1) \times i \).
     - Increment \( i \) by 1.
4. **Iterate Through Array**:
   - Initialize \( j \) to \( i \).
   - Loop through each element in the array until reaching the end (\( j < len(a) \)):
     - If \( k < len(a) \):
       - Check if \( a[j] + a[j+1] + a[j+2] \% 3 == 0 \):
         - If true, increment count by 1.
       - Otherwise, continue looping without changing \( k \) or updating \( j \).
5. **Final Count**:
   - Output the final value of count which holds the number of elements that satisfy the condition.
6. **End**: Conclude the process.

### Expected Output:
The output will be the count of numbers within the array `a` such that their sum of three consecutive elements modulo 3 equals zero. Additionally, it returns the computed factorial of the input number \( n \).

This step-by-step description outlines how the algorithm processes the input data and arrives at its expected result.
