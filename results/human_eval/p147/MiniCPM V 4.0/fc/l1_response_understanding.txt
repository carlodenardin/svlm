The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to count the number of distinct triples in a sequence that are multiples of 3. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Input**: An integer `n` is required as input, representing the dimension or length of the vector.
3. **Initialize Vector**: Create a vector of size `n` and initialize its elements with values according to the rule \( A[i-1] = i * i + i + 1 \) where \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). This means each element in the vector is calculated based on its index using this specific formula.
4. **Count Triples**: Iterate through all possible combinations of three indices (i, j, k) from 1 to n. For each combination, check if the sum \( A[i-1] + A[j-1] + A[k-1] \) is divisible by 3. If it is, increment a counter variable `count`.
5. **Output**: After evaluating all combinations, output the value of `count`, which represents the number of distinct sums of triples that are multiples of 3.
6. **End**: The process concludes at the end node.

This algorithm efficiently calculates the desired count by leveraging loops for iteration and conditional checks to filter valid triple sums.
