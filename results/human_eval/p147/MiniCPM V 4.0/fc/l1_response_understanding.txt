The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to count the number of distinct triples in a vector whose sum is a multiple of 3. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step description of the implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Input**: An integer `n` is required as input, which defines the dimension and size of the vector to be created.
3. **Vector Initialization**: A vector `A` of dimensions `[1 x n]` is initialized with values according to the rule `A[i-1] = i * i + i + 1` where `1 <= i <= n`. This involves iterating through each index from 1 to `n` and calculating the corresponding value for the vector elements.
4. **Triple Sum Calculation**: The next step involves counting how many sums of distinct triples are multiples of 3 within the vector `A`. This requires checking every possible combination of three elements to see if their sum is divisible by 3.
5. **Output**: Finally, the result (the count of such triples) is outputted at the end node.

This algorithm effectively utilizes loops and conditional checks to iterate over the vector and compute the desired properties efficiently.
