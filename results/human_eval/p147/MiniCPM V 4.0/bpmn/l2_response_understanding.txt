The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to count how many times a triple of elements from an initialized vector meets the condition where their sum is divisible by 3. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step implementation based on the provided image:

1. **Receive Input**: The process begins with receiving an integer \( n \) which represents the dimension of the vector.

2. **Initialize Vector**: Create a vector of size \( n \) and initialize its elements according to the rule \( A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1 \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). This sets up the initial values for each element in the vector.

3. **Set Counter**: Initialize a counter variable to zero. This will be used to keep track of the number of valid triples.

4. **Iterate Over Triples**: Use a loop to iterate over each possible combination of three consecutive elements in the vector \( A \). For each iteration, calculate the sum of these elements.

5. **Check Divisibility**: Check if the calculated sum of the current trio is divisible by 3. If it is, increment the counter by 1.

6. **Repeat Iteration**: Continue this process until all possible triples have been evaluated.

7. **Return Result**: After completing the iterations, return the value of the counter which now holds the total count of triples whose sums are multiples of 3.

This algorithm efficiently counts specific patterns within a predefined structure using simple arithmetic operations and loops.
