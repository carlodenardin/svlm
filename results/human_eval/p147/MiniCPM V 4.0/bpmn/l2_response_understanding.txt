The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to count the number of triples in a vector where each element is derived from the formula \( A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1 \) for indices \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). Here's a step-by-step description of its implementation:

1. **Receive Input**: Start by receiving an integer \( n \) which defines the dimension of the vector.
2. **Initialize Vector**: Initialize a vector of dimension \( n \) using the specified rule: 
   \[
   A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1 \quad \text{for} \quad 1 \leq i \leq n
   \]
3. **Set Counter**: Initialize a counter variable to zero to keep track of valid triples.
4. **Iterate Over Vector**: Loop through each element \( A[i-1] \) in the initialized vector.
5. **Check Triple Condition**: For each triple, check if the sum of the elements is divisible by 3 without any remainder. If true, increment the counter by 1.
6. **Return Result**: After iterating through all elements and counting the valid triples, return the final value of the counter.

This process ensures that only those triples meeting the condition are counted within the given constraints.
