```python
```python
def count_triples(n):
    triples_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            for k in range(j+1, n+1):
                if (i * i - i + 1) == (j * j - j + 1) == (k * k - k + 1):
                    triples_count += 1
    return triples_count % 3

# Example usage:
# Assuming the input is provided as an integer when calling the function
# result = count_triples(5)  # This would return the number of distinct triples from 1 to 5 that are multiples of 3
