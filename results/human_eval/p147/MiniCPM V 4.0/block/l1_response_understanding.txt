The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to determine how many distinct triples of a given list are sums that are multiples of 3. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this algorithm is to analyze a list of integers and count the number of unique triplets within the list whose sum is divisible by 3.

### Input Data:
- **Input**: An integer array or list `A` with dimensions n. The input must be an integer sequence where elements range from 1 to n inclusive.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receive Integer as Input**: Start by receiving the list of integers `A` as input.
2. **Create a List of Dimension n**: Initialize an empty list `A` with length `n` to store the generated numbers according to the specified rule.
3. **Populate the List Using the Rule**: Use a loop to populate the list `A` based on the following formula for each index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n):
   \[
   A[i-1] = i \times i - i + 1
   \]
4. **Count Distinct Triplets**: Iterate through all possible combinations of three elements in the populated list `A`. For each combination, check if their sum is divisible by 3. If so, increment a counter.
5. **Return Count of Sum Multiples of 3**: Finally, return the total count of such valid triplets found in the list.

### Expected Output:
The output will be an integer representing the number of distinct triplets in the list whose sum is a multiple of 3.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in implementing the required functionality.
