The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to determine how many distinct triples of a list are multiples of 3. Here's a step-by-step implementation based on the provided image:

### Algorithm Overview:
The purpose of this algorithm is to process an integer input and generate a list where each element follows a specific rule, then count how many unique triplets within this list result in sums that are multiples of 3.

### Input Data Required:
- An integer `n` representing the dimension of the list to be created.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receive an Integer as Input:**
   - The user inputs an integer value for `n`, which determines the size of the list to be generated.

2. **Create a List of Dimension n:**
   - Initialize an empty list named `A` with dimensions up to `n` (i.e., `[0] * n`).

3. **Populate the List with Specific Rule:**
   - Use nested loops to fill the list according to the given formula: `A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1` for `1 <= i <= n`. This means filling each position from index 0 to `n-1` using the specified mathematical expression.

4. **Count Distinct Triplets Summing to a Multiple of 3:**
   - Iterate through all possible combinations of three elements in the populated list.
   - For each combination, check if their sum is divisible by 3.
   - Count the number of such valid triples.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - Output the total count of distinct triples whose sums are multiples of 3.

### Example Implementation (Python):
```python
def count_triples_multiple_of_three(n):
    # Step 2: Create a list of dimension n
    A = [0] * n
    
    # Step 3: Populate the list with the specified rule
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1
    
    # Step 4: Count distinct triplets summing to a multiple of 3
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            for k in range(j, n):
                if (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return count

# Example usage
n = 5
result = count_triples_multiple_of_three(n)
print(f"Number of distinct triplets summing to a multiple of 3: {result}")
```
This code snippet outlines the steps described above, providing a clear structure for implementing the algorithm effectively.
