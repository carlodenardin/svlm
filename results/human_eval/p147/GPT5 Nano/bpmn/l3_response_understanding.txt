Certainly! Here is a step-by-step algorithm description, ready for implementation, based on the flowchart provided.

### **Overview**
This algorithm counts the number of unique triplets `(i, j, k)` with `i < j < k` in a specially generated sequence where the sum of the elements at those positions is divisible by 3.

---

### **Input Data**
- An integer **n**.

---

### **Main Logical Flow & Steps**

1. **Input:** Receive integer `n`.

2. **Initialize Sequence**
   - Create a vector **A** of size `n`.
   - Set each element as:  
     `A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

3. **Set Up Counters**
   - Initialize a **counter** to `0` (to count qualifying triplets).
   - Set `i = 1`.
   - **Note:** Indices in the pseudocode are 1-based, but use 0-based for typical programming languages.

4. **Triple-Nested Loop Structure**
   - **Loop 1:** While `i < n`:
     - Set `j = i + 1`
     - **Loop 2:** While `j < n`:
       - Set `k = j + 1`
       - **Loop 3:** While `k < n`:
         - **Check Condition:**  
           If `(A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0`:  
           - Increment `counter` by 1
         - Increment `k` by 1
       - Increment `j` by 1
     - Increment `i` by 1

5. **Output:** Return the **counter** value.

### **Expected Output**
- An integer representing the number of ordered triplets `(i, j, k)` chosen such that `i < j < k` and the sum of the elements at those indices is divisible by 3.

## **Pseudocode Example**

```python
def count_triplets(n):
    # Step 2: Initialize sequence
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    counter = 0
    # Step 4: Triple nested loop
    for i in range(0, n - 2):         # maps to i from 1 to n-2 (0-indexed)
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1): # maps to j from i+1 to n-1
            for k in range(j + 1, n): # maps to k from j+1 to n
                if (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    counter += 1
    return counter
```
