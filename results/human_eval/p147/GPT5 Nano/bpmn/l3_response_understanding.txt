**Overview of the Algorithmâ€™s Purpose:**
This algorithm counts the number of unique triplets (i, j, k) within a generated array of size n that satisfy a specific arithmetic condition: the sum of the elements at these positions is divisible by 3. The positions i, j, and k must be distinct and ordered such that i < j < k.

### 1. **Input Data Required**
- A single integer `n` (size of the array/vector).

---

### 2. **Main Logical Flow (Decision, Loops, and Function Calls)**

#### **Step 1: Generate the Array**
- Create an array `A` of size `n` using the rule:
  ```
  A[i-1] = i * i - i + 1; for 1 <= i <= n
  ```
  (Note: Array indexing is zero-based.)

#### **Step 2: Initialize Variables**
- Set a counter `count` to 0 (to hold the result).
- Set variable `i = 0`.

#### **Step 3: Outer Loop for i**
- While `i < n`:
  - Set `j = i + 1`.

  ##### **Step 4: Middle Loop for j**
  - While `j < n`:
    - Set `k = j + 1`.

    ###### **Step 5: Inner Loop for k**
    - While `k < n`:
      - Check if the sum `A[i] + A[j] + A[k]` is divisible by 3:
        ```
        if (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0:
            count += 1
        ```
      - Increment `k` by 1.
    - Increment `j` by 1.
  - Increment `i` by 1.

#### **Step 6: Output**
- After all loops, return the value of `count`.

---

### 3. **Expected Output**
- **An integer:** The total number of unique triplets `(i, j, k)` (with `i < j < k`) such that the sum of their corresponding array values is divisible by 3.

## **Pseudocode for Implementation**

```python
def count_divisible_triplets(n):
    # Step 1: Initialize array with the given rule
    A = [(i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(n)]
    count = 0

    # Step 2: Triple nested loops for i, j, k
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1

    return count
```

---

## **Summary**
- **Purpose:** Count unique triplets from an array generated via a formula, where the sum is divisible by 3.
- **Input:** Integer `n` (size of array).
- **Process:** Initialize array, iterate over all triplets with nested loops, check divisibility of sum, and count valid triplets.
- **Output:** Integer count of valid triplets.
