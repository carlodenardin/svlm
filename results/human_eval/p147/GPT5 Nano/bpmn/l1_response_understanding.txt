Here’s a clear description ready for implementation based on the provided flowchart:

---

#### **Algorithm Overview**
This algorithm counts how many distinct triples (combinations of three elements) from a generated vector sum up to a multiple of 3. The vector is built according to a specific formula based on the input integer.

---

#### **Input Data**
- A single positive integer **n**.

---

#### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Input**: Receive a positive integer `n`.
2. **Vector Initialization**:
    - Create a vector/array `A` of length `n`.
    - Populate each element in `A` according to the formula:
      - For index `i` from `1` to `n`:
        - `A[i - 1] = i * i - i + 1`
3. **Process Triples**:
    - Iterate over all possible **distinct triples** `(i, j, k)` such that `0 <= i < j < k < n`.
    - For each triple, compute the sum: `A[i] + A[j] + A[k]`.
    - If this sum is **divisible by 3**, increment the count.
4. **Output**:
    - Return or print the total count of such triples.

---

#### **Expected Output**
- A single integer: the number of distinct triples from the vector whose sum is a multiple of 3.

---

## **Example Implementation Skeleton (Python-style pseudocode)**
```python
def count_triples_multiple_of_three(n):
    # Step 1: Generate the vector
    A = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    count = 0
    
    # Step 2: Check all distinct triples
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if (A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count
```

**Notes:**  
- Time complexity is O(n³) due to the triple loop. For large n, consider optimizing or limiting n.
- Ensure the function receives the integer, builds the vector, processes, and outputs/counts the valid triples.
