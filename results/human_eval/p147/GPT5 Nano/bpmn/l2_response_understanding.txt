Certainly! Below is a structured breakdown of the algorithm depicted in the flowchart:

---

### **Algorithm Overview**

The goal of this algorithm is to count the number of consecutive triples in a sequence, where the sum of each triple is a multiple of 3. The sequence is generated by a specific formula applied to each index.

---

### **Input Data**

- **A single integer n**: Specifies the length of the vector to be generated.

---

### **Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Receive Input**
   - Read integer `n` from the user or another source.

2. **Initialize Vector**
   - Create an array/vector `A` of length `n`.
   - Populate the vector such that for each index `i` (where `1 <= i <= n`),  
     `A[i - 1] = i * i - i + 1`  
     (i.e., for index 0-based: `A[0] = 1*1 - 1 + 1 = 1`, `A[1] = 2*2 - 2 + 1 = 3`, etc.)

3. **Initialize Counter**
   - Set an integer variable `counter` to zero.

4. **Iterate Over Triples**
   - For each consecutive triple of elements in `A` (i.e., `(A[0], A[1], A[2])`, `(A[1], A[2], A[3])`, ..., up to `(A[n-3], A[n-2], A[n-1])`):
     - Calculate the sum of the triple.
     - If the sum is divisible by 3 (i.e., `sum % 3 == 0`), increment `counter` by 1.

5. **Return Result**
   - Output (or return) the value of `counter`.

---

### **Expected Output**

- **A single integer:**  
  The number of consecutive triples in vector `A` whose sum is a multiple of 3.

---

### **Pseudo-code Implementation**

```python
def count_triples_multiple_of_three(n):
    # Step 1: Initialize vector
    A = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    
    # Step 2: Initialize counter
    counter = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over triples
    for i in range(n - 2):
        triple_sum = A[i] + A[i+1] + A[i+2]
        if triple_sum % 3 == 0:
            counter += 1
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return counter
```
