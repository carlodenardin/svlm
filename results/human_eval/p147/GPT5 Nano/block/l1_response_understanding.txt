Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of the algorithm as depicted in the flowchart:

---
### **Overview**
This algorithm calculates how many sums of all possible distinct triples (groups of 3) from a specially generated integer list are multiples of 3.

---
### **Input Data Required**
- An integer `n`: the size of the list to be created.

---
### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Receive Input**
   - Read the integer value `n`.

2. **Create List of Size `n`**
   - Initialize an empty list `A` with size `n`.

3. **Populate the List**
   - For each index `i` in `1` to `n`:
     - Set `A[i - 1] = i^2 + i + 1`.

4. **Count Valid Triples**
   - Iterate over all possible combinations of three **distinct** elements from list `A`.
   - For each triple, check if the sum is a multiple of 3.
   - Keep a count of such valid triples.

---
### **Expected Output**
- Return (or print) the total count of triples (sets of three distinct elements) whose sum is a multiple of 3.

---
## **Pseudocode Implementation**

```python
def count_multiples_of_3(n):
    # Step 1: Generate the list A
    A = [i**2 + i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]

    # Step 2: Count valid triples
    from itertools import combinations
    count = 0
    for triple in combinations(A, 3):
        if sum(triple) % 3 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
print(count_multiples_of_3(n))
```

---
**Summary:**
1. Accept an integer input `n`.
2. Build a list of size `n` where each element follows the rule `A[i-1] = i^2 + i + 1`.
3. Iterate through all distinct triples, count those whose sum is divisible by 3.
4. Output the count.

This breakdown gives you all the necessary steps and logic to implement the depicted algorithm.
