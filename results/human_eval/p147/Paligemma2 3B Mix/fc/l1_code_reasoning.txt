"""
This file is a placeholder for translating a provided VLM (Vision-Language Model) reasoning
block into executable Python code that solves a specific problem.

Since the actual reasoning block was not provided in this message, this module contains
a clear guard that prompts the user to supply the reasoning content. Once the reasoning
text is provided (as a string), a separate translator would convert that reasoning into
an executable solver. Implementing that translator would require access to the exact
structure and content of the reasoning block.

Usage:
    - Provide the reasoning text as a string to the solve() function via the
      `reasoning_block` parameter.
    - Provide the input data for the problem via `problem_input` (any type as needed).

Example:
    reason = """[paste the VLM reasoning block here]"""
    result = solve(problem_input_data, reasoning_block=reason)

Note:
    This file intentionally does not attempt to improvise or guess the translation
    of the reasoning. It serves as a strict placeholder to ensure the contract is
    explicit: you must supply the reasoning content to proceed.
