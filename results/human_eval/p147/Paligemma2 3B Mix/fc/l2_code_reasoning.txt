Iâ€™m missing the actual reasoning text and the problem statement you want me to implement. Please provide:

- The reasoning/content of the small VLM (the step-by-step approach you want encoded).
- The exact problem statement or input/output specification the code should handle.

Once I have those, I will produce:
- A Python function(s) that strictly follow the given reasoning.
- The code enclosed in a Python code block.
- An ASCII flowchart drawn at the bottom of the message describing the process.
