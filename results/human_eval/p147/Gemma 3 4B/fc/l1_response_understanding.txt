Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**Overview:**

The algorithm aims to count the number of distinct triples of elements within a given vector (array) where each element in the triple is a multiple of 3.  Essentially, it's looking for sets of three numbers from the vector that are all divisible by 3.

**Input Data:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the size (number of elements) of the vector.
*   `vector`: A vector (array) of integers of size `n`.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a vector (array) named `vector` of size `n`.
    *   Initialize each element of the `vector` using the formula: `vector[i] = (i + 1) * (i + 2) + i` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This formula generates a sequence of numbers.

2.  **Triple Counting Loop:**
    *   Initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.
    *   Iterate through the `vector` using a loop from `i = 0` to `n - 3`.  (We stop at `n-3` because we need to form triples â€“ three elements).
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   For each `i`, iterate from `j = i + 1` to `n - 2`. (This ensures we consider all possible pairs of elements after `i`).
        *   For each `j`, iterate from `k = j + 1` to `n - 1`. (This forms the third element of the triple).
        *   Check if `vector[i]`, `vector[j]`, and `vector[k]` are all divisible by 3.
        *   If they are, increment the `count` by 1.

3.  **Output:**
    *   After the loops complete, the `count` variable will hold the total number of distinct triples of elements that satisfy the condition (all multiples of 3). Return `count`.

**Expected Output:**

The algorithm will return an integer representing the number of distinct triples of elements in the input vector where each element in the triple is a multiple of 3.

**Example:**

Let's say `n
