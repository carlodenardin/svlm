Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This flowchart implements an algorithm to count the number of distinct characters in a given string. It essentially determines the number of unique characters present within the input string.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   **`n`:** An integer representing the length of the input string.  (Although the flowchart doesn't explicitly show `n`, it's implied by the loop condition `i <= n`.)
*   **`a`:** A string (character array) representing the input string.  The flowchart initializes `a[0]` and then uses indexing to access characters within the string.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `n` is an integer (length of the string).
    *   `i` is initialized to 1.
    *   `a` is initialized to `a[0]`.
    *   `count` is initialized to 0.

2.  **Outer Loop (Character Iteration):**
    *   The `while` loop continues as long as `i <= n`. This loop iterates through each character of the string `a`.
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `a[i] = a[i] * i + i + 1` : This is the core logic. It calculates a value based on the current character `a[i]` and its index `i`. The calculation is `a[i] = a[i] * i + i + 1`.
        *   `i = i + 1`: Increment the index `i` to move to the next character in the string.

3.  **Inner Loop (Distinct Character Check):**
    *   The `while` loop continues as long as `i < len(a)`. This loop checks if the current character `a[i]` is distinct from the previous characters.
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `j = i + 1`: Initialize `j` to the next character index.
        *   `j = j + 1`: Increment `j` to move to the next character.
        *   `k = j + 1`: Initialize `k` to the next character index.
        *
