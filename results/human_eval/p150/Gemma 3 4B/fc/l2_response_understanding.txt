Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose**

This flowchart implements a primality test. Specifically, it determines if a given integer `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.

**2. Input Data Required**

*   `n`: An integer (whole number) that the algorithm will test for primality.
*   `x`: An integer. This variable is used as a counter and is not explicitly used in the flowchart.
*   `y`: An integer. This variable is used as a counter and is not explicitly used in the flowchart.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input:** The algorithm receives the integer `n` as input.
3.  **Check if n = 1:** The algorithm checks if `n` is equal to 1.
    *   If `n` is 1, the algorithm immediately outputs `y` and ends (1 is not a prime number).
4.  **Check for Divisors:** If `n` is not 1, the algorithm proceeds to check for divisors of `n` between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive).
    *   The algorithm iterates through integers `x` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.
    *   For each `x`, it checks if `x` is a divisor of `n` (i.e., if `n` is divisible by `x` without any remainder).
5.  **Divisor Found?**
    *   If a divisor `x` is found (meaning `n % x == 0`), the algorithm outputs `y` and ends (because `n` is not prime).
6.  **No Divisor Found:** If the loop completes without finding any divisors (meaning no number between 2 and the square root of `n` divides `n`), the algorithm outputs `x` and ends (because `n` is prime).

**4. Expected Output**

*   If `n` is 1, the output is `y`.
*   If `n` is a prime number, the output is `x`.
*   If `n` is
