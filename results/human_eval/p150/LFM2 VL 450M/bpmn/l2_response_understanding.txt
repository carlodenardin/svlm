The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given number is divisible by a specified divisor. The input data required is the number to be divided and the divisor. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive the number n and the divisor y.
2. Check if n is divisible by y. If not, return False.
3. Find a divisor of n from 2 to n-1. If not, return False.
4. If a divisor is found, return True.
5. If all the above conditions are met, return True.

The expected output is True if the number is divisible by the divisor, and False otherwise.
