The algorithm's purpose is to find a divisor of a given number n. The input data required is the number n. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive n in input the integers x, and y.
2. Find a divisor of n from 2 to n-1.
3. If a divisor is found, return it.
4. If no divisor is found, return y.

The expected output is the divisor of n.
