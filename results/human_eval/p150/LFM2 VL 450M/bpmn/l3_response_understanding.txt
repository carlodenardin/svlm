The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer x is divisible by 2. The input data required is the integer x. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive x in input.
2. Check if x is divisible by 2. If not, return False.
3. Set y to 0.
4. Check if y is divisible by 2. If not, return False.
5. Return x.
6. Increase x by 1.

The expected output is True if x is divisible by 2, and False otherwise.
