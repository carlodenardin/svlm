The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given number x is prime or not. It takes an input integer n and returns a boolean value indicating whether x is prime or not.

Input data required: The input integer n.

Main logical flow:

1. Check if n is less than or equal to 1. If true, return false since 1 and any number less than 1 are not prime.
2. Check if n is less than or equal to 3. If true, return true since 2 and 3 are prime numbers.
3. If n is greater than 3, check if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). If it is divisible by any number, return false.
4. If n is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n, return true.

Expected output: The algorithm returns true if n is prime, and false otherwise.
