The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. The input data required is the integer `n` and the integer `y`. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if `n` is equal to 1. If so, return `YES` (divisible by `y`).
3. Check if `n` is equal to 2. If so, return `NO` (not divisible by `y`).
4. If `n` is not equal to 1 or 2, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n` is divisible by `y` using a binary search approach. If `n` is divisible by `y`, return `YES` (divisible by `y`). If `n` is not divisible by `y`, check if `n
