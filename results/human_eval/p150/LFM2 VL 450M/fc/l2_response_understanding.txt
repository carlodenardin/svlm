The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given number 'n' is divisible by 'y' without any remainder. The input data required is the number 'n' and the divisor 'y'. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Check if 'n' is equal to 1. If so, return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
3. If 'n' is not equal to 1, check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
4. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
5. If 'n' is not divisible by 'y', check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
6. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
7. If 'n' is not divisible by 'y', check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
8. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
9. If 'n' is not divisible by 'y', check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
10. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
11. If 'n' is not divisible by 'y', check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
12. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
13. If 'n' is not divisible by 'y', check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
14. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
15. If 'n' is not divisible by 'y', check if 'n' is divisible by 'y' using the 'divisor' variable.
16. If 'n' is divisible by 'y', return 'Y' (divisible by 'y').
17. If 'n' is not divisible
