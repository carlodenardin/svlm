The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given number is prime or not. The input data required is the number to be checked. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Input n, x, as integers
3. Check if n is a prime number
4. If n is prime, end
5. If n is not prime, end
6. End

The expected output is the number of steps taken by the algorithm.
