**Algorithm Overview**
### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to find a divisor of a given integer `n` from 2 to the square root of `n`. It receives input in the form of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

### Input Data
- `n`: The integer to find a divisor for.
- `x`: An integer to be used in the algorithm.
- `y`: An integer to be used in the algorithm.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Check if `n` is equal to 1
If `n` is 1, the algorithm returns `y` without any further processing.

#### Step 2: Find a divisor of `n` from 2 to sqrt(n)
If `n` is not equal to 1, the algorithm finds a divisor of `n` from 2 to the square root of `n`. This step involves checking all numbers from 2 to `sqrt(n)` to see if any of them are divisors of `n`.

#### Step 3: Check if a divisor exists
If a divisor is found in step 2, the algorithm checks if `x` is a divisor of `n`. If `x` is a divisor, the algorithm returns `x`. Otherwise, it returns `y`.

#### Step 4: Return the divisor
If no divisor is found in step 3, the algorithm returns `y`.

### Expected Output
The algorithm returns the divisor `x` if a divisor is found, or `y` if no divisor is found.

### Implementation
```python
import math

def find_divisor(n, x, y):
    """

    Args:

    x (int): An integer to be used in the algorithm.
    y (int): An integer to be used in the algorithm.
    
    Returns:
    int: The divisor x if found, or y otherwise.
