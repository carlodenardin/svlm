**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers. It iterates through the numbers from 1 to n, adding them together and storing the result in a variable y. The algorithm then checks if the sum is less than or equal to n, and if so, it increments the variable i by 1. If the sum is greater than n, it returns the sum as the final result.

**Input Data:**
The input data required for this algorithm is an integer n, which represents the number of natural numbers to be summed.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by initializing the variable n to 1 and setting the variable y to 0.
2. **Loop**: The algorithm enters a loop that continues until n is greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Decision**: Inside the loop, the algorithm checks if n is less than or equal to the square root of n (i <= sqrt(n)). If this condition is true, the algorithm increments the variable i by 1 and continues to the next iteration.
4. **Decision**: If n is greater than or equal to the square root of n, the algorithm checks if the sum of the numbers from 1 to n is less than or equal to n. If this condition is true, the algorithm returns the sum as the final result.
5. **Return**: If the sum is greater than n, the algorithm returns the sum as the final result.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers and returns it as the final result.

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_sum(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        if i <= n:
            i += 1
        else:
            return sum(range(1, n + 1))
    return n

# Example usage:
n = 5
result = calculate_sum(n)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```
This implementation uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers. It checks if the sum is less than or equal to n, and if so, increments the variable i by 1. If the sum is greater than n, it returns the sum as the final result.
