**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer input. It iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n`, adding them together and storing the result in a variable `y`. The algorithm then returns `y` as the final output.

### Input Data
* `n`: an integer input representing the number of positive integers to sum

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Input Validation
* Check if `n` is a positive integer. If not, raise an error.

#### Step 2: Loop Through Numbers
* Initialize a variable `i` to 1 and a variable `sum` to 0.
* Iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n` using a loop.
* For each number `i`, add `i` to `sum` and increment `i` by 1.
* After the loop, `sum` will hold the sum of the first `n` positive integers.

#### Step 3: Return the Sum
* Return the final sum `sum` as the output.

### Expected Output
* The sum of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer input.

### Implementation
```python
def sum_of_integers(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the first n positive integers.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of positive integers to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the first n positive integers.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is not a positive integer.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

    sum = 0
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        sum += i
        i += 1

    return sum

# Example usage:
n = 5
result = sum_of_integers(n)
print(f"The sum of the first {n} positive integers is: {result}")
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's steps, including input validation, loop through numbers, and returning the sum. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a specific input value.
