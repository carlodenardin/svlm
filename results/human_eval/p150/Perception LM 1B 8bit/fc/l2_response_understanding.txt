**Algorithm Overview**
======================

The algorithm is designed to find the largest divisor of a given integer `n` that is less than or equal to its square root. The input data required is an integer `n`, and the expected output is the largest divisor of `n` that is less than or equal to its square root.

**Step-by-Step Process**
------------------------

### Step 1: Input Data

*   The algorithm takes an integer `n` as input.
*   The input `n` is stored in a variable `x`.

### Step 2: Check Divisors

*   The algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root.
*   If the square root of `n` is an integer, it means `n` is a perfect square, and the algorithm returns `n`.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if `n` is a perfect square by calculating its square root again.
*   If the square root of `n` is
