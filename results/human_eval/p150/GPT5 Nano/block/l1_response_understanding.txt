Certainly! Here’s a **code-ready breakdown** of the algorithm illustrated in the flowchart:

---

### **Overview**
The algorithm determines if a given integer `n` is a prime number. Depending on the result, it returns either `x` or `y`.

---

### **Input Data**
- Three integers:
  - `n`: The number to test for primality.
  - `x`: The value to return if `n` is prime.
  - `y`: The value to return if `n` is not prime.

---

### **Main Logical Flow**
1. **Input Reception**  
   - Receive three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`) as input.
   
2. **Prime Number Check**  
   - **If** `n` is less than 2:  
     - `n` is not prime.
   - **Else**, check divisibility from 2 up to √n:
     - **Loop** from `i = 2` to `sqrt(n)` (inclusive):
       - **If** `n % i == 0`:
         - `n` is not prime.
         - **Break** out of loop/check.
   - **If** no divisors were found:
     - `n` is prime.
   
3. **Decision & Output**  
   - **If** `n` is prime:
     - **Return `x`**
   - **Else**:
     - **Return `y`**

---

### **Pseudocode**
```python
def process_numbers(n, x, y):
    # Step 1: Input already received as parameters
    
    # Step 2: Check if n is prime
    if n < 2:
        return y
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    
    # Step 3: Return x if n is prime
    return x
```

---

### **Expected Output**
- **If** `n` is a prime number: returns `x`.
- **Otherwise:** returns `y`.

#### **Summary Table**

| Input (`n`, `x`, `y`) | Output |
|-----------------------|--------|
| 7, 10, 20             | 10     |
| 8, 10, 20             | 20     |
