**Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose:**  
This algorithm determines whether a given integer `n` is **prime** (with special handling for `n=1`), and based on this test, outputs either value `x` or value `y`.

---

**Input Data Required:**
- `n` (integer): The number to be tested for primality.
- `x` (integer): Value to output if `n` is prime (other than 1).
- `y` (integer): Value to output if `n` is not prime or if `n` is 1.

---

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Initialize Inputs:**  
   Receive `n`, `x`, `y`.

2. **Check if n is 1:**  
   - If `n == 1`, output `y` and terminate.
   - Otherwise, continue.

3. **Prime Test:**  
   - For each integer `i` from 2 to `sqrt(n)` (inclusive), check if `n` is divisible by `i`:
     - If any such `i` exists (i.e., `n % i == 0`), output `y` and terminate.
     - If **no** such divisor is found (i.e., the loop completes with no divisors), output `x` and terminate.

---

**Expected Output:**
- `y` if:
  - `n == 1`, **or**
  - `n` has a divisor from 2 to `sqrt(n)` (i.e., `n` is not prime).
- `x` if:
  - `n > 1` **and** `n` is prime (i.e., no divisors in [2, sqrt(n)]).

---

**Pseudocode Example:**  
```python
def custom_prime_check(n: int, x: int, y: int):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    return x
```

**Key Points for Implementation:**
- Use integer square root for the upper bound in the divisor loop.
- Edge case (n == 1) is immediately handled as non-prime.
- Efficient: the divisor check only goes up to `sqrt(n)`.

---

**Summary:**  
This algorithm checks if `n` is a prime number (with `n=1` being a special non-prime case) and produces a specific output depending on primality.
