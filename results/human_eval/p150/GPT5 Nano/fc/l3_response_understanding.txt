Certainly! Here’s a clear implementation plan based on the flowchart:

---

### **Overview**
This algorithm determines a property of a given integer `n` (such as primality), and depending on the result, assigns the value of either `x` or `y`. It tests for divisibility in the range 2 to √n.  
**Likely Purpose:** Determine if `n` is prime (where `x` and `y` hold results for prime/non-prime cases).

---

### **Input Data**
- `n`: Integer to test.
- `x`: Integer to use if `n` passes the primality test (often for "prime" result).
- `y`: Integer to use if `n` does not pass the primality test (often for "not prime" result).

---

### **Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**
1. **Start the algorithm.**
2. **Input values:**  
   Read integers `n`, `x`, `y`.
3. **Check if `n == 1`:**  
   - If **YES** (`n` is 1):  
     Return or output `y` (since 1 is not a prime).
   - If **NO**:  
     Continue to next step.
4. **Initialize `i = 2`**.
5. **Repeat while `i <= sqrt(n)` do:**
   - If `i > sqrt(n)`, output `x` (no divisors found; `n` is "prime"); **END**.
   - If `n % i == 0`:  
     Output `y` (divisor found; `n` is "not prime"); **END**.
   - Otherwise:  
     Increment `i` by 1, repeat loop.
6. **End algorithm.**

---

### **Expected Output**
- Returns/prints either `x` or `y`:
  - `x` if `n` is considered "prime" (no divisors found except 1 and itself).
  - `y` if `n` is 1 or not "prime" (has divisors other than 1 and itself).

---

### **Implementation Sketch (e.g., in Python)**
```python
import math

def algorithm(n, x, y):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    i = 2
    while i <= math.isqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
        i += 1
    return x
```

---

**Summary:**  
The algorithm checks if `n` is 1 or composite and outputs a corresponding value (`y`). Otherwise, for primes, it outputs `x`. This is suitable for applications such as basic primality checking or branching logic based on number properties.
