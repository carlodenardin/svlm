Certainly! Here is a clear breakdown of the algorithm represented in the flowchart:

---

### **Overview**
The algorithm checks whether an input number `n` is a prime number and outputs one of two values (`x` or `y`) based on the result.  
- **Purpose:** Conditional value selection based on the primality of a given number.

---

### **Input Data Required**
- Three integers:  
  - `n` (the number to test for primality)  
  - `x` (the output if `n` is prime)  
  - `y` (the output if `n` is not prime)  

---

### **Main Logical Flow**
1. **Input Step:**  
   - Read or accept three integers from the user: `n`, `x`, and `y`.

2. **Primality Check:**  
   - Determine whether `n` is a prime number:
     - If `n` is less than 2, it is **not** prime.
     - If `n` is 2, it **is** prime.
     - If `n > 2`, iterate through all integers from 2 up to `sqrt(n)`:
       - If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is **not** prime.
       - Otherwise, it **is** prime.

3. **Conditional Output:**  
   - If `n` **is** prime, output `x`.
   - If `n` **is not** prime, output `y`.

---

### **Expected Output**
- A single integer:  
  - `x` if `n` is prime  
  - `y` if `n` is not prime

---

### **Sample Pseudocode**

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Input n, x, y
n = int(input("Enter n: "))
x = int(input("Enter x: "))
y = int(input("Enter y: "))

if is_prime(n):
    print(x)
else:
    print(y)
```

**Summary:**  
This algorithm provides a basic structure to check for primality and conditionally choose and output between two values based on that result. The key components are input collection, a primality check function, and a conditional output.
