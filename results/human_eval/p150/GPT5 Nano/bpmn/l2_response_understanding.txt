Certainly! Here is a step-by-step explanation, ready for implementation, of the algorithm represented in the flowchart:

---

### **Overview**

This algorithm checks if the given integer `n` is equal to 1, prime, or composite. Based on these checks, it returns one of the two values, `x` or `y`, as specified in the input.

---

### **Input Data Required**

- Three integers:  
  - `n` (the number to be checked)
  - `x` (return value for composite numbers)
  - `y` (return value for when `n` is 1 or prime)

---

### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Input**:  
   Receive integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

2. **Check if `n` is 1**:  
   - If `n == 1`, **return `y`** and terminate.

3. **Check for Divisors (Primality Test)**:  
   - For each integer `i` from 2 to `sqrt(n)` **(inclusive)**:
     - If `n % i == 0` (**divisor exists**):
       - **Return `x`** (composite) and terminate.

4. **If No Divisor is Found**:  
   - **Return `y`** (`n` is prime).

---

### **Expected Output**

- Returns `y` if `n` is 1 or prime.
- Returns `x` if `n` is composite.

---

### **Pseudocode**

```python
def special_return(n, x, y):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return x
    return y
```
