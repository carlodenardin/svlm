### **Algorithm Overview**
The algorithm's purpose is to inspect an integer \( n \) for certain properties related to factorization and return a specified output based on the results. In essence, it checks if \( n \) is 1, or if \( n \) has any divisors (other than 1) up to its square root.

---

### **Input Data**
- **n**: Integer to be tested.
- **x**: Integer to be returned if \( n \) has no divisors (other than 1) up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **y**: Integer to be returned if \( n \) is 1 or has a divisor in the loop range.

---

### **Main Logical Flow**

1. **Input**: Receive the three integers: \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   
2. **Check if \( n = 1 \)**:
   - If yes, **return \( y \)** and terminate.
   - If no, continue to step 3.

3. **Initialize**: Set \( i = 2 \).

4. **Loop**: While \( i \leq \sqrt{n} \), do the following:
   - **Divisibility Test**: If \( n \% i == 0 \) (i.e., \( i \) divides \( n \)),
     - **Return \( y \)** and terminate.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - Increase \( i \) by 1 and loop.

5. **If loop exits** (i.e., no divisors found for all \( i \) in [2, \(\sqrt{n}\)]):
   - **Return \( x \)**.

---

### **Expected Output**
- **Output \( y \)**: If \( n = 1 \) or if \( n \) has any divisor \( i \) in the range 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Output \( x \)**: If \( n \) is not 1 and has no divisors in the range 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\) (i.e., \( n \) is prime).

---

### **Pseudo-code Implementation**
```python
def check_number(n, x, y):
    if n == 1:
        return y
    i = 2
    while i <= int(n**0.5):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
        i += 1
    return x
```

---

**Summary**:  
This algorithm checks if \( n \) is 1 or composite (returns \( y \)), or prime (returns \( x \)). Input required: \( n, x, y \). The main decision points are: is \( n = 1 \)? Does \( n \) have divisors between 2 and \(\sqrt{n}\)? The process ends early if a divisor is found, otherwise, it confirms \( n \) is prime.
