### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to calculate the value of a mathematical expression involving a variable `x` and a constant `y`. The expression is evaluated recursively, with the variable `x` being updated based on the result of the expression. The algorithm starts with an initial value of `x = 0` and `y = 0`, and it continues to update `x` and `y` until the expression is simplified to a constant value.

### Input Data

The algorithm requires the following input data:

*   `x`: The variable to be updated in the expression.
*   `y`: The constant value in the expression.

### Main Logical Flow

1.  **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with `x = 0` and `y = 0`.
2.  **Recursive Evaluation**: The algorithm evaluates the expression recursively, updating `x` and `y` based on the result of the expression.
3.  **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when the expression is simplified to a constant value.

### Expected Output

The expected output of the algorithm is a constant value `y`.

### Step-by-Step Process

1.  **Initialization**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
2.  **Recursive Evaluation**:
    *   Evaluate the expression `x + y`.
    *   If `x` is not equal to 1, recursively evaluate the expression `x + y` with the updated value of `x`.
    *   If `x` is equal to 1, update `y` to the result of the recursive evaluation.
3.  **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when the expression is simplified to a constant value.

### Pseudocode

```
function evaluateExpression(x, y):
    if x!= 1:
        evaluateExpression(x + y)
    else:
        y = evaluateExpression(x, y)
    return y
```

### Implementation

The algorithm can be implemented using a recursive function in a programming language such as Python. Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
def evaluateExpression(x, y):
    if x!= 1:
        return evaluateExpression(x + y)
    else:
        return y
```

This implementation follows the same logic as the pseudocode, with the recursive function `evaluateExpression` taking two inputs `x
