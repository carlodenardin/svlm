### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to calculate the value of a mathematical expression involving a variable `x` and a constant `y`. The expression is `n * x + y`, where `n` is an integer and `x` and `y` are constants. The algorithm starts with an initial value of `n` set to 1 and iteratively calculates the value of `x` and `y` based on the given expression. The final output is the result of the expression evaluated with the initial values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.

### Input Data

- `n`: An integer representing the number of times the expression should be evaluated.
- `x`: A constant value.
- `y`: A constant value.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Initialization**: Set `n` to 1.
2. **Iteration**: For each iteration from 1 to `n`:
   - Calculate `x` as `x * n`.
   - Calculate `y` as `y * n`.
3. **Termination**: After `n` iterations, the final value of `x` and `y` are returned as the result of the expression.

### Expected Output

The output is the result of the expression `n * x + y`, evaluated with the initial values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Start**: Begin the algorithm.
2. **Initialize**: Set `n` to 1.
3. **Loop**: Iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - **Calculate x**: `x = x * n`
   - **Calculate y**: `y = y * n`
4. **End**: After the loop, return the final values of `x` and `y`.
5. **End**: End the algorithm.

### Pseudocode

```
START
  n = 1
  FOR i = 1 TO n
    x = x * n
    y = y * n
  END FOR
  RETURN x + y
END
```

### Conclusion

The algorithm efficiently calculates the value of the expression `n * x + y` by iterating `n` times and updating `x` and `y` in each iteration. The final result is the sum of `n` and
