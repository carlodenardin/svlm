### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to perform a series of operations on a set of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`. The primary purpose is to determine the value of `y` based on the input values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. The algorithm uses a combination of arithmetic operations and conditional statements to compute the result.

### Input Data

The algorithm requires three inputs:
- `n`: an integer.
- `x`: an integer.
- `y`: an integer.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive Input**: The algorithm starts by receiving the integers `n`, `x`, and `y` as input.

2. **Check if `n` is even**:
   - If `n` is even, the algorithm proceeds to the next step.
   - If `n` is not even, the algorithm returns the value of `y`.

3. **Set `i` to 2**:
   - If `n` is even, the algorithm sets `i` to 2.

4. **Calculate `x`**:
   - The algorithm calculates `x` using the formula `x = sqrt(n)`.

5. **Check if `x` is greater than or equal to `sqrt(n)`**:
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, the algorithm proceeds to the next step.
   - If `x` is less than `sqrt(n)`, the algorithm returns the value of `x`.

6. **Calculate `y`**:
   - If `x` is less than `sqrt(n)`, the algorithm calculates `y` using the formula `y = x * y`.

7. **Increase `i` by 1**:
   - If `i` is not equal to 2, the algorithm increases `i` by 1.

### Expected Output

The expected output of the algorithm is the value of `y`. If `n` is even and `x` is greater than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, the algorithm returns the value of `y`. If `n` is even and `x` is less than `sqrt(n)`, the algorithm returns the value of `x`. If `n` is odd, the algorithm returns the value of `x`. If `n` is odd and `x` is less than `sqrt(n
