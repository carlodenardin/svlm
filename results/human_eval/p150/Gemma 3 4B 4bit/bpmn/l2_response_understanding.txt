Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to be designed to determine if two integers, `x` and `y`, are relatively prime (or coprime).  Two integers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.  The flowchart implements a specific method to calculate the GCD.

**2. Input Data**

The algorithm requires the following input:

*   `n`: An integer.
*   `x`: An integer.
*   `y`: An integer.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the three integer values `n`, `x`, and `y` as input.

2.  **Check if n is equal to 1:**  The first decision point checks if `n` is equal to 1.
    *   If `n` is equal to 1, the algorithm immediately returns `y`.

3.  **Find a Divisor:** If `n` is not equal to 1, the algorithm proceeds to find a divisor of `n` within the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).  This is done by iterating through numbers in that range.

4.  **Check for Divisor:** After finding a potential divisor, the algorithm checks if that divisor exists.
    *   If a divisor is found, the algorithm returns `y`.

5.  **Return x:** If no divisor is found within the specified range, the algorithm returns `x`.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm's expected output is:

*   If `n` is 1, the output is `y`.
*   If a divisor of `n` is found between 2 and `sqrt(n)`, the output is `y`.
*   If no divisor of `n` is found between 2 and `sqrt(n)`, the output is `x`.

**In essence, the algorithm is attempting to find a common divisor of `n` and `y`. If it finds a divisor of `n` within the specified range, it assumes that `y` is also a divisor of `n` and therefore the GCD is 1. If no such divisor is found, it concludes that `x` is the GCD.**

**Note:** This algorithm is a simplified approach
