Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm appears to be designed to calculate a value based on whether a given number `n` is prime or not. It seems to be returning a different value depending on the primality of `n`.  It's likely a function that returns `x` if `n` is prime and `y` if `n` is not prime.

**2. Input Data**

The algorithm requires the following input:

*   **n:** An integer (a whole number). This is the number being tested for primality.
*   **x:** An integer. This is the value to be returned if `n` is prime.
*   **y:** An integer. This is the value to be returned if `n` is not prime.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the three integer inputs: `n`, `x`, and `y`.
2.  **Primality Test:** The core of the algorithm is a check to determine if `n` is a prime number.  This is done with a "n is prime?" conditional statement.
3.  **If n is Prime:** If the primality test determines that `n` *is* prime, the algorithm immediately returns the value `x`.
4.  **If n is Not Prime:** If the primality test determines that `n` is *not* prime, the algorithm returns the value `y`.
5.  **Loop Termination:** The flowchart indicates a loop (represented by the circles) that suggests the algorithm ends after the primality test and the return statement.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will produce one of the following outputs:

*   **x:** If the input number `n` is a prime number.
*   **y:** If the input number `n` is not a prime number.

**In essence, this algorithm is a simple conditional function that returns a predetermined value based on whether a number is prime or not.**

**Implementation Notes (for a programmer):**

*   **Primality Test:**  The "n is prime?" check would require a primality test function.  A basic primality test could involve checking for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of `n`.  More sophisticated tests (like Miller
