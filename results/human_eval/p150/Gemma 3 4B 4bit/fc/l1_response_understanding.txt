Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given integer `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.

**2. Input Data**

The algorithm requires the following input:

*   `n`: An integer (whole number) that the algorithm will test for primality.
*   `x`: An integer, likely representing a counter or iteration variable.
*   `y`: An integer, likely representing another counter or iteration variable.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

Here's a breakdown of the algorithm's steps, mirroring the flowchart:

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input:** The algorithm prompts the user to enter three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`. These are stored as variables.
3.  **Prime Check:** The algorithm proceeds to check if `n` is a prime number.
4.  **Decision (Is n prime?):**
    *   **YES:** If `n` is determined to be prime, the algorithm proceeds to the next step.
    *   **NO:** If `n` is *not* prime, the algorithm ends.
5.  **Loop (Implicit):**  The flowchart doesn't explicitly show a loop, but the "y" variable suggests a loop is involved.  The algorithm likely iterates from `x` to `y` (inclusive) to check for divisibility.  This loop is the core of the primality test.
6.  **Divisibility Check (Inside the Loop):**  Within the loop, for each value of `y`, the algorithm checks if `n` is divisible by `y` without any remainder.  This is typically done using the modulo operator (`%`).  If `n % y == 0`, it means `y` is a divisor of `n`, and `n` is *not* prime.
7.  **Loop Termination:** The loop continues until `y` reaches a value where `n` is no longer divisible by `y`.  This implicitly determines the upper limit of the loop.
8.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.
