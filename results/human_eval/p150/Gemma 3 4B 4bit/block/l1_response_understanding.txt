Okay, let's break down the algorithm represented by the flowchart.

**Overview:**

The algorithm's purpose is to determine if a given integer `n` is a prime number. If `n` is prime, it returns the value `x`. Otherwise, it returns the value `y`.  Essentially, it's a function that checks primality and provides a specific output based on the result.

**Input Data:**

The algorithm takes three integer inputs:

*   `n`: The integer to be tested for primality.
*   `x`:  This is the value to be returned if `n` is a prime number.
*   `y`: This is the value to be returned if `n` is *not* a prime number.

**Logical Flow (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the three integer inputs: `n`, `x`, and `y`.

2.  **Primality Test:** The core of the algorithm is a primality test.  Here's how it would likely be implemented (though the specific implementation details aren't shown in the flowchart):
    *   **Check for Divisibility:**  The algorithm iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`.  For each number in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by that number without any remainder.
    *   **If Divisible:** If `n` is divisible by any number in the range, it means `n` is not a prime number.  The algorithm immediately exits and returns `y`.
    *   **If Not Divisible:** If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it means `n` is a prime number.

3.  **Return Value:**
    *   **If `n` is prime:** The algorithm returns the value `x`.
    *   **If `n` is not prime:** The algorithm returns the value `y`.

**Expected Output:**

*   **If `n` is a prime number:** The algorithm will return the value of `x`.
*   **If `n` is not a prime number:** The algorithm will return the value of `y`.

**Example:**

Let's say:
*   `n = 7`
*   `x = 100`
*   `y = -1`

The algorithm would:
