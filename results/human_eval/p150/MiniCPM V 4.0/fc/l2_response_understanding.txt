The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. Here's a step-by-step implementation based on the provided image:

1. **Start**: The process begins here.
2. **Input Data**: 
   - `n`: An integer representing the first number.
   - `x`: Another integer representing the second number.
3. **Initialize Loop Counter**: Set `n` to 1 since it is used as a loop counter initially.
4. **Check for Divisors**: Enter a loop that continues while `n` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
5. **Iterate Through Divisors**: For each value of `n` from 2 to the square root of `n`, check if `n` is a divisor of `x`.
6. **Determine GCD**: If a divisor is found, set `y` to this divisor and terminate the process with "End".
7. **Update Loop Counter**: If no divisor is found within the range, increment `n` by 1 and repeat the iteration through divisors.
8. **Output Result**: Once all possible values of `n` have been checked, output the final result `x`, which will be the greatest common divisor of the initial inputs `n` and `x`.

This algorithm efficiently finds the GCD by repeatedly reducing the problem size until a divisor is identified, making use of mathematical properties related to divisibility and optimization techniques like limiting the search space to the range up to the square root of one of the numbers.
