The flowchart represents an algorithm designed to find all the divisors of a given integer \( n \). Here is a step-by-step description:

1. **Input Data**: The algorithm requires three integers as input - \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). However, in this specific diagram, these inputs are not explicitly used within the main logic but may be for other purposes or context outside what's shown here.

2. **Initialization**: Start by setting \( n = 1 \).

3. **Main Loop**: Begin with a loop that iterates while \( n \) remains equal to 1.
   - Increment \( i \) from 2 onwards (i.e., set \( i = 2 \)).

4. **Check Divisibility**: Within the loop, check if \( i \) is less than the square root of \( n \). If true, proceed to process \( x \).

5. **Divisibility Check**: If \( i \) divides \( n \) evenly (i.e., \( n \% i == 0 \)), then assign \( y \).

6. **Increment Iterator**: Regardless of whether \( i \) was found to divide \( n \), increment \( i \) by 1 to continue checking subsequent values.

7. **End Condition**: Continue the loop until no further divisor can be identified based on the current value of \( i \) being less than the square root of \( n \).

8. **Output**: Once the loop ends, output the result corresponding to either \( x \) or \( y \) depending on the conditions met during the iterations.

**Expected Output**: The algorithm outputs all the divisors of \( n \). For example, if \( n = 12 \), it would yield [2, 3, 4, 6, 12].

This structured approach ensures efficient computation of divisors using mathematical properties such as only needing to iterate up to the square root of \( n \).
