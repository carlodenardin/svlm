The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to determine whether a given integer \( n \) is a prime number. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Input Data**: The first action is to input three integers, denoted as \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
3. **Check Primality**: Next, verify if \( n \) is a prime number. This involves checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \( n \).
4. **Decision Point**: Based on the primality check:
   - If \( n \) is prime (YES): Proceed with processing or further actions designated by 'x'.
   - If \( n \) is not prime (NO): Continue with subsequent steps marked by 'y'.
5. **End**: Regardless of the outcome, the process concludes here.

**Expected Output**:
- If \( n \) is found to be a prime number, output 'x'.
- If \( n \) is not a prime number, output 'y'.

This structured approach ensures clarity in determining the nature of the provided integer efficiently.
