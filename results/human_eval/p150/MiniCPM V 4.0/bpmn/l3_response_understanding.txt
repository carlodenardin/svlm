The algorithm depicted in the flowchart is designed to compute a specific mathematical result based on input integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step implementation of the algorithm:

### Algorithm Overview
The purpose of this algorithm is to calculate an output value using given integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) through a series of logical steps involving loops and conditional checks.

### Input Data Required
- Three integer inputs: \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).

### Main Logical Flow
1. **Start**: Begin with receiving the input values for \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
2. **Check Condition**: Determine if \( n \) equals 1.
   - If yes, return the value of \( y \).
   - If no, proceed to set \( i \) to 2.
3. **Set Initial Value**: Assign \( i \) the initial value of 2.
4. **Loop Execution**:
   - While \( i < \sqrt{n} \):
     - Check if \( n \% i == 0 \).
       - If yes, increment \( i \) by 1 (i.e., increase \( i \) by 1).
       - If no, continue looping without changing \( i \).
5. **Return Result**:
   - After exiting the loop, check if \( n \% i == 0 \).
     - If yes, return the value of \( x \).
     - If no, return the value of \( y \).
6. **Increment Counter**: Increase \( i \) by 1 after each iteration within the loop.

### Expected Output
The final output will be either \( x \) or \( y \) depending on whether \( n \) is divisible by \( i \) up to its square root. Specifically:
- If \( n \) divides evenly into \( x \), then \( x \) is returned.
- Otherwise, \( y \) is returned.

This structured approach ensures that the algorithm efficiently processes the input data to produce the desired outcome.
