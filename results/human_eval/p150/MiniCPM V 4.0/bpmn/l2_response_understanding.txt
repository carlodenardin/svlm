The algorithm's purpose is to determine if there exists a divisor of the integer \( n \) within the range from 2 to the square root of \( n \).

**Input Data:**
- Three integers: \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).

**Main Logical Flow:**
1. **Start**: Begin with receiving input values for \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
2. **Decision Point 1**: Check if \( n \) equals 1.
   - If yes, proceed directly to return \( y \).
   - If no, continue to the next step.
3. **Step 1**: Find all divisors of \( n \) in the range from 2 to the square root of \( n \) (denoted as \( \sqrt{n} \)).
4. **Decision Point 2**: Determine if any divisor has been found.
   - If no divisor exists, proceed directly to return \( x \).
   - If a divisor exists, proceed to the final output step.
5. **Output Step**: Return \( y \).

**Expected Output:**
- The value of \( y \) if a divisor is found between 2 and \( \sqrt{n} \).
- The value of \( x \) otherwise.

This flowchart outlines an efficient method to check for divisibility constraints on \( n \) using mathematical properties related to its factors.
