The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to determine the value of \( y \) based on certain conditions involving integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).

### Algorithm Overview:
The purpose of this algorithm is to decide whether a given integer \( n \) is prime, and then return either \( x \) or \( y \) accordingly.

### Input Data Required:
- An integer \( n \) 
- Two other integers \( x \) and \( y \)

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: Begin the process by receiving input for the integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
2. **Check Primality**: Determine if \( n \) is a prime number using a primality test function (not detailed in the chart but assumed available).
   - If \( n \) is prime, proceed with returning \( x \).
   - If \( n \) is not prime, continue processing.
3. **Return \( y \)**: Regardless of the primality check result, directly output \( y \) as the final answer.

### Expected Output:
- The algorithm will return one of two values: \( x \) if \( n \) is prime, otherwise it returns \( y \).

This step-by-step process ensures that the correct value is determined based on the specified conditions without additional loops or complex conditional structures beyond those depicted in the flowchart.
