The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer \( n \) is a prime number. If it is, the function should return \( x \); otherwise, it should return \( y \).

### Input Data:
- The input consists of three integers: \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receiving Input**: 
   - Accept three integers as input: \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).

2. **Checking for Primality**:
   - Implement a function `is_prime(n)` that checks if \( n \) is a prime number.
   - Use an iterative loop from 2 to the square root of \( n \) (inclusive) to check divisibility.
   - If any divisor divides \( n \) exactly without leaving a remainder, then \( n \) is not a prime number.
   - Return `False` in this case.
   - If no divisors are found within the range, conclude that \( n \) is a prime number and proceed to output \( x \).

3. **Returning Output**:
   - After determining whether \( n \) is prime using the `is_prime` function, return the value stored in \( x \).
   - If \( n \) is not prime, return the value stored in \( y \).

### Expected Output:
- The output will be either \( x \) or \( y \) depending on whether \( n \) is determined to be a prime number or not.

This step-by-step process ensures clarity and precision in implementing the flowchart logic effectively.
