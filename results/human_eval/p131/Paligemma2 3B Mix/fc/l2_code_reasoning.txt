Iâ€™m missing the specific reasoning text you want me to translate into code. Please provide:

- The exact problem statement or the task you want the Python function to solve.
- The reasoning steps produced by the small VLM (as plain text) that I should implement verbatim.

Once I have that, I will output:
- A Python function that follows the given reasoning exactly (no changes),
- The required flowchart diagram rendered as ASCII at the bottom of the page.
