Overview:
The algorithm is designed to calculate the percentage of odd numbers in a given list of integers. It iterates through the list, checks if each number is odd, and accumulates the count of odd numbers.

Input Data:
The input data required is a list of integers.

Main Logical Flow:
1. Initialize a variable `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers.
2. Iterate through each number `n` in the list:
   a. Check if `n` is odd using the modulo operator `%`. If `n % 2!= 0`, increment `odd_count` by 1.
3. After iterating through all numbers, the value of `odd_count` will be the total count of odd numbers in the list.

Expected Output:
The expected output is the total count of odd numbers in the list.

Pseudocode:
```
function calculate_odd_count(numbers):
    odd_count = 0
    for n in numbers:
        if n % 2!= 0:
            odd_count += 1
    return odd_count
```

Note: The pseudocode provided is a simplified representation of the algorithm. The actual implementation may vary based on the programming language and specific requirements.
