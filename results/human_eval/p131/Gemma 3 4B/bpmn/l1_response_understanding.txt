Okay, let's break down this flowchart algorithm and outline its implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the product of the odd digits of a given integer. If the integer contains no odd digits, the algorithm returns 0.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** An integer (whole number).  Let's call this `n`.

**3. Logical Flow & Implementation Steps**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm's logic:

1.  **Receive Integer:**  The algorithm starts by receiving the integer `n` as input.
2.  **Initialize Product:**  A variable `product` is initialized to 1. This will store the product of the odd digits.
3.  **Iterate Through Digits:** The algorithm iterates through each digit of the integer `n`.  This can be done by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 and taking the remainder.  The remainder represents the last digit.
4.  **Check for Odd Digit:** Inside the loop, for each digit:
    *   Check if the digit is odd. This can be done by checking if the digit modulo 2 is equal to 1 (i.e., `digit % 2 != 0`).
5.  **Multiply if Odd:** If the digit is odd, multiply the current value of `product` by the digit.
6.  **No Odd Digits Check:** After iterating through all the digits, check if the `product` is still 1. If it is, it means no odd digits were found in the integer.
7.  **Return Result:** If `product` is 1, return 0. Otherwise, return the final value of `product`.

**4. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** An integer.
    *   If the input integer `n` contains at least one odd digit, the output is the product of all the odd digits in `n`.
    *   If the input integer `n` contains no odd digits, the output is 0.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `n = 12345`
    *   Odd digits: 1, 3, 5
    *   Product: 1 * 3 * 5 = 15
    *   **Output:** 15
