    """
    Implements the described (flawed) flowchart algorithm:
    - Start with a running value 'p' initialized to 0.0.
    - Process the digits of the non-negative integer 'n' from the rightmost digit to the leftmost.
      For each digit d:
        - If d is odd: p = p * 10 + d
        - If d is even: p = p / 10 + d
    - Return the final value of p as a float.

    Notes:
    - The digits are obtained by repeatedly taking n % 10 and then integer-dividing by 10.
    - Negative inputs are treated by using their absolute value.
    - For n = 0, the single digit 0 is processed as an even digit.
