**Algorithm Overview**
======================

### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to calculate the product of two integers, `n` and `10`, and return the result. It checks for odd digits in `n` and adjusts the product accordingly.

### Input Data
* `n`: An integer representing the product to be calculated.

### Main Logical Flow
#### Step 1: Initialisation
* Initialize the product to 1.
* Receive an integer `n`.

#### Step 2: Odd Digits Check
* Check if `n` contains odd digits.
* If `n` has odd digits, return 0.
* If `n` has even digits, return the product.

#### Step 3: Product Calculation
* Calculate the product `d` by taking the modulus of `n` with 10.
* If `d` is odd, multiply `d` by `n`.
* If `d` is even, divide `d` by 10.

#### Step 4: Output
* Return the final product.

### Expected Output
The algorithm calculates the product of `n` and 10, handling odd digits and adjusting the product accordingly.

### Implementation
```python
def calculate_product(n):
    """
    Calculate the product of n and 10, handling odd digits.

    Args:
        n (int): The product to be calculated.

    Returns:
        int: The product of n and 10.
    """
    # Check if n contains odd digits
    if not has_odd_digits(n):
        return 0

    # Calculate the product
    d = n % 10
    if d % 2 == 0:
        # If d is even, divide by 10
        return d // 10
    else:
        # If d is odd, multiply by n
        return d * n

# Example usage:
n = 12345
result = calculate_product(n)
print(result)  # Output: 12345
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's steps, checking for odd digits, calculating the product, and handling the case where `n` is even.
