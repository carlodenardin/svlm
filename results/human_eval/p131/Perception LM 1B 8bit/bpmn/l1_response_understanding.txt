**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to compute the product of the odd digits of a given integer. It receives an integer as input, computes the product of the odd digits, and returns the product or 0 if no odd digits are present.

**Input Data:**
The algorithm requires an integer as input.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive an integer**: The algorithm starts by receiving an integer as input.
2. **Compute the product of the odd digits of n**: The algorithm then computes the product of the odd digits of the input integer `n`.
3. **Return the product or 0 if no odd digits are present**: If the input integer `n` has no odd digits, the algorithm returns the product of the odd digits. Otherwise, it returns 0.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm's expected output is the product of the odd digits of the input integer, or 0 if no odd digits are present.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm's implementation is as follows:

*   Initialize an empty variable `result` to store the product of the odd digits.
*   Iterate over each digit in the input integer `n`.
*   For each digit, check if it is odd by using the modulo operator (`n % 2 == 1`).
*   If the digit is odd, add it to the `result`.
*   After iterating over all digits, return the `result` or 0 if no odd digits are present.

**Example Use Case:**
For example, if the input integer is 123, the algorithm would compute the product of the odd digits as follows:

*   Input: 123
*   Output: 1 (since 1 is odd)
*   Result: 1

In this case, the algorithm returns the product of the odd digits, which is 1.
