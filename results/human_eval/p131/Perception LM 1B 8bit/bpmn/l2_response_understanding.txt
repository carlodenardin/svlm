**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to compute the product of the odd digits of a given integer. It receives an integer as input, checks if it contains odd digits, and if so, computes the product of these odd digits. If the input number is even, the algorithm returns 0.

**Input Data:**
- The input is an integer.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive an integer**: The algorithm starts by receiving an integer as input.
2. **Odd digits in n?**: It checks if the input number contains odd digits. If it does, the algorithm proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, it returns 0.
3. **Compute the product of the odd digits of n**: If the input number contains odd digits, the algorithm computes the product of these odd digits. This step is performed using a loop that iterates over each digit of the number.
4. **Return the product**: After computing the product of the odd digits, the algorithm returns the result.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm's expected output is the product of the odd digits of the input integer. If the input number is even, the algorithm returns 0.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm's implementation can be achieved using a simple loop that iterates over each digit of the input number. For each digit, it checks if the digit is odd and, if so, computes the product of the odd digits. The final output is the product of these odd digits.
