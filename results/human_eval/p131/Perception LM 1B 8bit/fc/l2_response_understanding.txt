**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to compute the multiplication between the odd digits of a given integer `n`. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the product of its odd digits.

**Input Data:**
The input data required for this algorithm is an integer `n`, which can be any non-negative integer.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Start**: The algorithm begins with the input `n` and initializes a variable `result` to 0.
2. **n: int**: The algorithm checks if `n` is an integer. If not, it throws an error.
3. **At least one odd digit in n**: If `n` is not an integer, the algorithm checks if it has at least one odd digit. If not, it throws an error.
4. **Compute the multiplication between the odd digits of n**: If `n` has at least one odd digit, the algorithm computes the product of these odd digits.
5. **product**: The algorithm multiplies the product of the odd digits by the input `n`.
6. **End**: The algorithm ends with the product of the odd digits and the input `n`.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns the product of the odd digits of the input `n`.

**Implementation:**
```python
def compute product_of_odd_digits(n):
    """
    Compute the product of the odd digits of a given integer n.

    Args:
        n (int): The input integer.

    Returns:
        int: The product of the odd digits of n.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is not an integer.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise ValueError("Input must be an integer")

    # Check if n has at least one odd digit
    if not any(int(digit) % 2 == 1 for digit in str(n)):
        raise ValueError("Input must have at least one odd digit")

    # Compute the product of the odd digits
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            product *= int(digit)

    return product

# Example usage:
n = 12345
result = compute product_of_odd_digits(n)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```
This implementation follows the algorithm's logical flow and includes error handling for invalid inputs.
