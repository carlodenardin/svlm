## Overview of the Algorithm's Purpose

The algorithm calculates the **product of all odd digits in a given integer**. If there are no odd digits in the integer, it returns 0.

---

## Input Data Required

- A single integer `n`.

---

## Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive Input**
    - Accept an integer `n` as input.
2. **Check for Odd Digits**
    - Inspect each digit of `n`.
    - If there are no odd digits in `n`, return `0`.
3. **Compute Product**
    - If the integer has odd digits, compute the product of all such digits.
    - Multiply all odd digits together.
4. **Return Output**
    - Return the computed product as the result.

### Detailed Steps

- Initialize a flag or counter to check for the presence of odd digits.
- Initialize a variable, `product`, to 1 to store the product of odd digits.
- For each digit `d` in `n` (consider the absolute value to avoid issues with negative numbers):
    - If `d` is odd (i.e., `d % 2 != 0`):
        - Multiply `product` by `d`.
        - Set the flag/counter to indicate at least one odd digit was found.
- After examining all digits:
    - If no odd digit was found, return `0`.
    - Else, return `product`.

## Expected Output

- **If the input integer contains at least one odd digit:** The product of all odd digits in the integer.
- **If the input integer contains no odd digits:** `0`.

## Example

- **Input:** `23456`
  - Odd digits: 3, 5
  - Product: 3 Ã— 5 = 15
  - **Output:** `15`
- **Input:** `2468`
  - Odd digits: None
  - **Output:** `0`
