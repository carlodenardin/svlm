The algorithm's purpose is to receive an integer, compute the product of its odd digits, and return the product or 0 if no odd digits are present.

Input data required: An integer n.

Main logical flow:
1. Receive an integer n.
2. Compute the product of the odd digits of n.
3. Return the product or 0 if no odd digits are present.

Expected output: The product of the odd digits of n or 0 if no odd digits are present.
