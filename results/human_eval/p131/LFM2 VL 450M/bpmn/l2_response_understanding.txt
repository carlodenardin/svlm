The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether an integer is odd or even. The input data required is an integer. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive an integer
2. If the integer is odd, return 0
3. If the integer is even, return the integer
4. If the integer is neither odd nor even, return the integer

The expected output is the integer itself.
