The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given product is equal to a specified value. The input data required is the product and the value to compare. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive an integer product.
2. Initialize product to 1.
3. Check if the product is equal to the given value.
4. If the product is equal to the given value, return the product.
5. If the product is not equal to the given value, return the given value.
6. If the product is not equal to the given value, check if the product is even.
7. If the product is even, return the product.
8. If the product is not even, check if the product is divisible by 10.
9. If the product is divisible by 10, return the product.
10. If the product is not divisible by 10, check if the product is equal to the given value.
11. If the product is equal to the given value, return the product.
12. If the product is not equal to the given value, return the given value.

The expected output is the product if it is equal to the given value, or the given value if it is not equal to the given value.
