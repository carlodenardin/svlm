The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a given integer n is odd or even. It takes an integer n as input and checks if n is divisible by 2. If n is divisible by 2, it prints "0" and ends the process. If n is not divisible by 2, it prints "1" and continues the process. The algorithm uses a decision-making process to evaluate the input and determine the output. The expected output is "0" if n is even and "1" if n is odd.
