The algorithm's purpose is to determine whether a product is valid based on its flag value. The input data required is the product flag value. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. n = 0
3. product = 1
4. n = 1
5. product = 0
6. product = 0
7. product = 0
8. product = 0
9. product = 0
10. product = 0
11. product = 0
12. product = 0
13. product = 0
14. product = 0
15. product = 0
16. product = 0
17. product = 0
18. product = 0
19. product = 0
20. product = 0

25. product = 0
26. product = 0
27. product = 0
28. product = 0
