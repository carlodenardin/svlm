The algorithm's purpose is to calculate the product of the positive integers in a given list. The input data required is a list of positive integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start: Initialize the product variable to 1.
2. Loop through the list: For each integer in the list, check if it is a positive integer.
3. If the integer is positive: Multiply the product variable by the current integer.
4. If the integer is not positive: Return the product variable.
5. End: Return the product variable.

The expected output is the product of all positive integers in the given list.
