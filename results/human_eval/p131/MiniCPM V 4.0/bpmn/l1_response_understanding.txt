The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to compute the product of the odd digits of an integer. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

1. **Receive Input**: Start by receiving an integer `n` as input. This is typically done using user input or reading from a file/database.
   
2. **Extract Odd Digits**: 
   - Convert the integer `n` into a string to easily access each digit.
   - Initialize a variable, say `product`, to store the product of the odd digits. Set it initially to 1 (or 0 if no odd digits are found).
   - Iterate through each character in the string representation of `n`.
   - Check if the current character represents a digit and whether it is odd. If both conditions are met, multiply the `product` by this digit.

3. **Return Result**: After processing all digits, return the value stored in `product`. If there were no odd digits present during the iteration, the result will be 0.

4. **End Process**: The process ends here with the computed product being ready for further use or output.

This straightforward approach ensures that we handle any positive integer input effectively, computing only the desired product based on the specified logic.
