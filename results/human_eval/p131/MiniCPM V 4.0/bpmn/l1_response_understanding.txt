The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to compute the product of the odd digits of a given integer. Here's a detailed step-by-step implementation:

### Overview
The purpose of this algorithm is to take an integer as input, identify and multiply its odd digits, and return the result or 0 if no odd digits are present.

### Input Data
- **Input**: An integer \( n \).

### Main Logical Flow
1. **Start**: Begin processing with the received integer \( n \).
2. **Initialize Product**: Set up a variable `product` to store the product of odd digits initially to 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the value).
3. **Check for Odd Digits**: Iterate through each digit of \( n \) using modulo operation to check if it is odd.
   - If the remainder when divided by 2 is 1, then the digit is odd.
4. **Multiply Odd Digits**: Multiply the current odd digit into the `product` variable.
5. **End Condition**: Continue checking digits until all have been evaluated.
6. **Return Result**: After completing the iteration, return the computed `product`. If no odd digits were found, return 0.
7. **End**: Conclude the process.

### Pseudocode Implementation
```pseudo
function calculateOddDigitProduct(n):
    product = 1
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit % 2 == 1:
            product *= digit
        n //= 10
    return product
```

### Example Execution
For example, consider the number 3456:
1. The last digit is 6 (odd), so update product = 1 * 6 = 6.
2. Next digit is 5 (odd), update product = 6 * 5 = 30.
3. Next digit is 4 (even), skip updating product.
4. Next digit is 3 (odd), update product = 30 * 3 = 90.
5. Next digit is 4 (even), skip updating product.
6. Next digit is 3 (odd), update product = 90 * 3 = 270.
7. All digits processed, return 270.

This structured approach ensures clarity in handling even and odd digits efficiently within the algorithm.
