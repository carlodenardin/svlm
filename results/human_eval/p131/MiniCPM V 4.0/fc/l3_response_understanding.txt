The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to compute the product of all odd digits in a given integer `n`. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input**: The algorithm requires an integer input, denoted as `n`.
2. **Initialization**: Set the variable `product` to 1 and initialize another flag `odd_flag` to 0.
3. **Main Loop**:
   - Check if `n` is greater than 0 (`n > 0`).
     - If true, proceed to calculate the last digit of `n` by taking `n % 10`, storing it in `d`.
     - Check if `d` modulo 2 is not equal to 0 (`d % 2 != 0`).
       - If true, multiply the current value of `product` by `d` and set `odd_flag` to 1.
     - Otherwise, divide `n` by 10 using `n //= 10` to remove the last digit from `n`.
4. **End Condition**: Repeat steps 3 until `n` becomes 0.
5. **Output**: After processing all digits, return or output the final value of `product` which contains the product of all odd digits encountered during the loop.

This process ensures that only odd digits are considered for multiplication, effectively filtering out even digits and maintaining their original position (flagged with `odd_flag`).
