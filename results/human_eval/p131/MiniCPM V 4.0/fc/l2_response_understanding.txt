The algorithm depicted in the flowchart aims to compute the multiplication of odd digits present in a given integer \( n \). Here is a step-by-step description and implementation:

1. **Start**: Begin the process.
2. **Input**: Accept an integer \( n \) as input.
3. **Check for Odd Digits**: 
   - Determine if there is at least one odd digit within \( n \).
   - If no odd digits are found, proceed directly to the end.
4. **Extract Odd Digits**:
   - Convert the integer \( n \) into a string or use modulo operations to extract each digit individually.
   - Identify and store all odd digits encountered during this extraction.
5. **Compute Multiplication**:
   - Multiply the identified odd digits together to get the product.
6. **Output Result**: 
   - The computed product represents the result of multiplying all the odd digits from the original number \( n \).
7. **End**: Terminate the process.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```plaintext
function multiplyOddDigits(n):
    product = 1
    foundOddDigits = false
    
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit % 2 != 0:
            product *= digit
            foundOddDigits = true
        n //= 10
    
    if not foundOddDigits:
        return 0
    else:
        return product
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: Start by taking an integer \( n \) as input.
- **Checking for Odd Digits**: Iterate through each digit of \( n \) using division by 10. Check if the digit is odd (i.e., remainder when divided by 2 is non-zero).
- **Multiplication Process**: If an odd digit is found, multiply it with the current value of `product`. Mark that an odd digit has been found (`foundOddDigits`).
- **Output**: If no odd digits were detected after checking all digits, return 0. Otherwise, return the final product obtained from the multiplication of odd digits.

This structured approach ensures that the algorithm accurately identifies and multiplies only the odd digits from the provided integer, producing the expected output.
