The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to calculate the product of the odd digits of a given positive integer \( n \). Here is a step-by-step description of its implementation:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Input**: A positive integer \( n \) is required as input.
3. **Processing**: 
   - Convert the integer \( n \) into a string to easily access each digit.
   - Initialize a variable `product` to 1, which will store the product of the odd digits encountered.
4. **Iteration and Condition Checking**:
   - Loop through each character in the string representation of \( n \).
   - For each character (digit), check if it is an odd number by using the modulo operator (`%`) with 2. If the remainder is not zero, the digit is odd.
5. **Product Calculation**:
   - Multiply the current value of `product` by the identified odd digit.
6. **Output**: Once all digits have been processed, return the final value of `product`.
7. **End**: The process concludes here.

This straightforward approach ensures that only the odd digits are considered for multiplication, adhering to the specified conditions outlined in the flowchart.
