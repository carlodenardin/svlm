I'll provide a step-by-step description of the algorithm's implementation.

**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers and keep the last k elements. It takes an integer k as input and returns a sorted list of integers.

**Input Data:**
The algorithm requires a single input parameter, k, which represents the number of elements to keep in the sorted list.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Start**: The algorithm begins by initializing a variable `start` to 0, which will keep track of the current position in the list.
2. **List of integer and an integer k**: The algorithm then initializes a list `list` to store the input integers and a variable `k` to represent the number of elements to keep.
3. **Sort the list and keep the last k elements**: The algorithm sorts the list in ascending order and keeps the last k elements in the `list`. This is done using a sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort.
4. **List**: The sorted list is then returned as the output.
5. **End**: The algorithm ends with a final output.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns a sorted list of integers, with the last k elements kept in the list.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm can be implemented using a simple programming language, such as Python or Java. The implementation would involve the following steps:

* Initialize variables `start`, `list`, and `k`
* Sort the list using a sorting algorithm
* Keep the last k elements in the list
* Return the sorted list

Here is a simple Python implementation of the algorithm:
```python
def sort_list(k):
    list = []
    start = 0
    while start < k:
        # Sort the list in ascending order
        list.append(sorted(list))
        # Keep the last k elements in the list
        list = list[:k]
        start += 1
    return list
```
Note that this is a simplified implementation and may not be efficient for large inputs. In practice, more efficient sorting algorithms and data structures would be used.
