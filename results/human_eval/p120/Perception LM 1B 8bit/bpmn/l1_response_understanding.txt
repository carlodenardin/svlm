**Algorithm Overview: Sorting a List with a Variable K**
===========================================================

**Purpose:** The algorithm sorts a list of integers and a variable `k` to return the sorted list with only the last `k` elements.

**Input Data:**

* A list of integers
* A variable `k`

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive a list of integers and a variable k**: The algorithm receives a list of integers and a variable `k`.
2. **Return the sorted list with only the last k elements**: The algorithm returns the sorted list with only the last `k` elements.

**Expected Output:**

The sorted list with only the last `k` elements.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Initialize an empty list `sorted_list` to store the sorted elements.
2. Iterate through the input list and `k` elements.
3. For each element, check if it is less than or equal to `k`.
4. If it is, append it to the `sorted_list`.
5. After iterating through all elements, return the `sorted_list`.

**Example Use Case:**

Input: `sorted_list = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]`, `k = 3`
Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`

Note: This algorithm assumes that the input list and `k` are valid and can be used to sort the list.
