**Algorithm Overview:**
The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order and return the last k elements. It receives a list of integers and a variable k as input.

**Input Data:**
- List of integers
- Variable k

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Receive a list of integers and a variable k**: This is the starting point of the algorithm. It receives the input data and stores it in variables.
2. **Sort the list in ascending order**: This is the core operation of the algorithm. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
3. **Return the last k elements**: After sorting, the algorithm returns the last k elements of the sorted list.

**Expected Output:**
The algorithm returns the last k elements of the sorted list of integers in ascending order.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Initialize an empty list to store the sorted elements.
- Iterate through the sorted list, adding each element to the list.
- Once the list is full (i.e., it contains k elements), return the last k elements.

**Code Representation:**
While the exact implementation details are not provided, the algorithm can be represented in a programming language like Python or Java, using a list and a variable k to control the sorting and return operations.
