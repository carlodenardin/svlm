**Algorithm Overview: Sorting a List of Integers**
=====================================================

**Purpose:** To sort a list of integers in ascending order.

**Input Data:** A list of integers and an integer `k` as input.

**Main Logical Flow:**

1. **Input Processing:**
	* Receive a list of integers and an integer `k` as input.
	* No specific processing is required for the input data.
2. **Sorting:**
	* Sort the list using a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
	* The sorting algorithm is not specified, but it is assumed to be implemented in a programming language.
3. **Output:**
	* Return the sorted list with the last `k` elements.

**Expected Output:**
The sorted list with the last `k` elements.

**Implementation:**
The algorithm's implementation is not provided, but it can be implemented using a programming language such as Python or Java. The sorting algorithm can be implemented using a recursive approach or an iterative approach, such as quicksort or mergesort.

**Example Use Case:**
Suppose we have a list of integers `[5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]` and an integer `k = 3`. The algorithm would sort the list as follows:

1. Receive the list and `k` as input.
2. Sort the list using a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort).
3. Return the sorted list with the last `k` elements.

The sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`.
