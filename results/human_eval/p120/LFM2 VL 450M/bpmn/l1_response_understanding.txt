The algorithm's purpose is to sort a list of integers and variables in ascending order. The input data required is a list of integers and variables, represented as a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer and a variable name. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of integers and variables, represented as a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer and a variable name.
2. Sort the list of integers and variables in ascending order.
3. Return the sorted list with only the last k elements.

The expected output is a sorted list of integers and variables, with the last k elements included.
