The algorithm's purpose is to sort a list of integers and variables. The input data required is a list of integers and variables. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of integers and variables.
2. Sort the list of integers and variables in ascending order.
3. Return the sorted list of integers and variables.

The expected output is the sorted list of integers and variables.
