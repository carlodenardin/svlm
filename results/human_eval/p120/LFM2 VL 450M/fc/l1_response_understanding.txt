The algorithm's purpose is to sort a list of integers and keep the last k elements sorted. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Create an empty list to store the sorted elements.
3. Iterate through the input list.
4. For each element, check if it is less than the last element in the list.
5. If it is, add it to the list and sort it in ascending order.
6. If it is not, add it to the list and sort it in descending order.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the list is empty.
8. End

The expected output is a sorted list of integers.
