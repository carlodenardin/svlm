The algorithm's purpose is to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The input data required is an array of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Start
2. Initialize an empty array to store the sorted integers.
3. Iterate through the input array.
4. For each element in the input array, compare it with the elements in the sorted array.
5. If the element is less than the element in the sorted array, swap the two elements.
6. After the loop, the sorted array will be in ascending order.
7. End

The expected output is the sorted array of integers.
