The algorithm's purpose is to sort a list of integers in ascending order. The input data required is a list of integers. The main logical flow is as follows:

1. Receive a list of integers and an integer k as input.
2. Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
3. Return the sorted list with the last k elements.

The expected output is a sorted list of integers.
