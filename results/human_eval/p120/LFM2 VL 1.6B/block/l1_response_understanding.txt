### Algorithm Implementation Overview

#### Purpose
The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order. It takes a list of integers and an integer `k` as input, and returns the list with the last `k` elements sorted in ascending order.

#### Input Data
- **List of Integers**: A list of integers that needs to be sorted.
- **Integer `k`**: An integer that determines the number of elements to be sorted at the end of the list.

#### Main Logical Flow
1. **Receive Input**: The algorithm starts by receiving a list of integers and an integer `k` as input.
2. **Sort the List**: The algorithm sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
3. **Return Sorted List**: The sorted list is then returned.

#### Expected Output
- The output is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, with the last `k` elements being the sorted list.

#### Detailed Steps
1. **Receive Input**:
   - Input: `list_of_integers` and `integer_k`.
   - Example: `list_of_integers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2]` and `integer_k = 3`.

2. **Sort the List**:
   - Use a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) to sort the `list_of_integers` in ascending order.
   - Example: After sorting, `list_of_integers` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`.

3. **Return Sorted List**:
   - The sorted list is returned as the output.
   - Example: The output is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`.

### Pseudocode
```plaintext
function sort_list(list_of_integers, integer_k):
    // Sort the list in ascending order
    sort(list_of_integers)
    
    // Return the sorted list
    return list_of_integers
```

### Example Implementation in Python
```python
def sort_list(list_of_integers, integer_k):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    list_of_integers.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return list_of_integers

# Example usage
list_of_integers = [5, 3
