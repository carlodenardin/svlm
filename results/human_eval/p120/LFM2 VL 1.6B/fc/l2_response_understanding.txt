### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order. It takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list. The algorithm uses a simple sorting technique, which is not the most efficient for large datasets but is sufficient for small to medium-sized lists.

### Input Data

- **List of integers**: The input is a list of integers, which can be represented as an array or a list in various programming languages.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
   - If the list contains only one element, return the list as it is already sorted.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - Use a sorting function that sorts the list in ascending order. In Python, this can be done using the built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method of a list.
   - The sorting function should take the list as input and return the sorted list.

3. **Output**:
   - Return the sorted list.

### Example Implementation in Python

```python
def sort_list(int_list):
    # Step 1: Input Validation
    if not int_list:
        return []
    if len(int_list) == 1:
        return int_list

    # Step 2: Sorting the List
    sorted_list = sorted(int_list)

    # Step 3: Output
    return sorted_list

# Example usage
input_list = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2]
sorted_output = sort_list(input_list)
print(sorted_output)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The input list `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]` is checked. It is not empty and has more than one element, so it is valid.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order. The sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]` is returned as the output.
