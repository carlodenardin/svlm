### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to process a list of integers and a variable `k`, and return a sorted list containing only the last `k` elements. The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently sort a list by keeping track of the last `k` elements seen so far.

### Input Data

- **List of integers**: A sequence of integers that needs to be sorted.
- **Variable `k`**: An integer that determines the number of elements to keep in the sorted list.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Initialize a sorted list**: Start with an empty list that will hold the sorted elements.
2. **Receive a list of integers and a variable `k`**: Input the list and the value of `k`.
3. **Process the list**:
   - **Loop through the list**: For each element in the list:
     - **Check if the list has `k` elements**: If the length of the list is less than `k`, continue to the next element.
     - **Append the element to the sorted list**: If the list has at least `k` elements, append the current element to the sorted list.
   - **Return the sorted list**: After processing all elements, return the sorted list containing only the last `k` elements.

### Expected Output

- **Sorted list**: A list of integers sorted in ascending order, containing only the last `k` elements from the input list.

### Pseudocode

```
function sortLastKElements(list, k):
    sortedList = []
    for i from 0 to length(list) - 1:
        if length(sortedList) < k:
            sortedList.append(list[i])
        else:
            sortedList.append(list[i])
    return sortedList
```

### Implementation

```python
def sort_last_k_elements(lst, k):
    sorted_list = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if len(sorted_list) < k:
            sorted_list.append(lst[i])
        else:
            sorted_list.append(lst[i])
    return sorted_list
```

This implementation follows the described algorithm, ensuring that the list is sorted by keeping track of the last `k` elements seen so far.
