### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order using the `list.sort()` function. It takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list.

### Input Data

- A list of integers, `k`, which is the input data required for the algorithm.

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive a list of integers and a variable `k`**: The algorithm starts by receiving a list of integers and a variable `k`, which represents the length of the list.

2. **Sort the list using `list.sort()`**: The algorithm calls the `list.sort()` function to sort the list of integers in ascending order.

3. **Return the sorted list**: The sorted list is returned as the output of the algorithm.

### Expected Output

- The algorithm returns a sorted list of integers in ascending order.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def sort_list(k):
    # Receive a list of integers and a variable k
    integers = k
    
    # Sort the list using list.sort()
    integers.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return integers
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage
k = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
sorted_list = sort_list(k)
print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
```

In this example, the algorithm receives a list `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]` and returns the sorted list `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]`.
