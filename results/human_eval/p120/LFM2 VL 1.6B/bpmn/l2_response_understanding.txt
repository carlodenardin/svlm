### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is designed to process a list of integers and a variable number of elements, sorting the integers in ascending order and returning the last k elements. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to sort a list and then retrieve the last k elements, such as in data analysis or processing large datasets.

### Input Data Required

- A list of integers (e.g., `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]`)
- An integer `k` (the number of elements to return)

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive a list of integers and a variable number of elements, `k`:**
   - This step involves accepting the input data and determining the value of `k`.

2. **Sort the list in ascending order:**
   - The algorithm sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is typically done using a sorting algorithm like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort.

3. **Return the last k elements:**
   - After sorting, the algorithm retrieves and returns the last `k` elements from the sorted list.

### Expected Output

- The output is a list containing the last `k` elements of the sorted list of integers. For example, if the input list is `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]` and `k = 3`, the output will be `[8, 5, 3]`.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Input: List of integers `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]` and `k = 3`.
   - Input: List of integers `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]` and `k = 3`.

2. **Sort the List:**
   - Use a sorting algorithm to sort the list in ascending order.
   - Example: After sorting, the list becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`.

3. **Retrieve the Last k Elements:**
   - Determine the length of the sorted list.
   - Return the last `k` elements from the sorted list.
   - Example: Return `[8, 5, 3]`.
