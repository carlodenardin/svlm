Okay, let's break down the algorithm described by the flowchart.

**Overview:**

The algorithm's purpose is to take a list of integers and a number *k* as input. It sorts the list in ascending order and then returns a new list containing only the last *k* elements of the sorted list.

**Input Data:**

*   **List of Integers:** A list (or array) containing integer values.
*   **Integer *k*:**  An integer representing the number of elements to be included in the output list.  *k* must be a non-negative integer and less than or equal to the length of the input list.

**Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the list of integers and the integer *k* as input.

2.  **Sort the List:** The input list is sorted in ascending order.  This can be done using various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort).  The choice of algorithm will impact the efficiency of the process.

3.  **Extract the Last *k* Elements:** After sorting, the algorithm extracts the last *k* elements from the sorted list.  This can be achieved by slicing the list.  For example, in Python, this would be `sorted_list[-k:]`.

4.  **Return the Result:** The algorithm returns the newly created list containing the last *k* elements of the sorted list.

**Expected Output:**

A new list containing the last *k* elements of the sorted input list.  The elements in the output list will be in ascending order.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]` and *k* is 3.

1.  **Sort:** The list becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]`.
2.  **Extract Last *k*:** The last 3 elements are `[8, 9, 5]`.
3.  **Return:** The algorithm returns the list `[8, 9, 5]`.
