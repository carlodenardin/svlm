Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**Overview:**

The algorithm's purpose is to extract the last *k* elements from a given list of integers. It sorts the list first and then returns a new list containing only the elements from index *k* to the end of the original list.

**Input Data:**

*   **`list`**: A list of integers.
*   **`k`**: An integer representing the number of elements to extract from the end of the list.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the input list of integers and the integer `k`.

2.  **Sort the List:** The core of the algorithm is the `list.sort()` function. This function sorts the input list in ascending order *in-place*.  This means the original list is modified directly.

3.  **Slice the List:** After sorting, the algorithm uses list slicing to extract the desired portion of the list.  `list[-k:]` creates a new list containing elements from index `-k` (k elements from the end) to the end of the list.

4.  **Return the Sublist:** The algorithm returns the newly created sublist containing the last *k* elements of the sorted list.

**Expected Output:**

The algorithm will return a new list containing the last *k* elements of the original list, sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**

Let's say:

*   `list = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]`
*   `k = 3`

1.  The list is sorted: `list` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]`
2.  The slice `list[-3:]` is applied. This extracts elements from index -3 (3 elements from the end) to the end.
3.  The output will be `[8, 9, 5]`

**Code Snippet (Python):**

```python
def get_last_k_elements(list_of_integers, k):
  """
  Extracts the last k elements from a list of integers and returns them in a new list.

  Args:
    list_of_integers: A list of integers.
