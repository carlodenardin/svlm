Okay, let's break down this flowchart algorithm and outline its implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to extract the last *k* elements from a sorted list of integers. It first sorts the input list in ascending order and then returns the final *k* elements.

**2. Input Data**

*   **List of Integers:** A list (or array) containing integer values.
*   **Integer k:**  An integer representing the number of elements to retrieve from the end of the sorted list.

**3. Logical Flow & Implementation Steps**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm's logic:

1.  **Receive Input:**
    *   The algorithm begins by receiving the list of integers and the integer *k* as input.

2.  **Sort the List:**
    *   Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) to sort the input list of integers in ascending order.  The choice of sorting algorithm will impact the overall time complexity.

3.  **Determine the Length of the List:**
    *   Calculate the length (number of elements) of the sorted list. Let's call this `list_length`.

4.  **Check for Valid Input:**
    *   **Validation:**  Ensure that *k* is a valid input.  Specifically:
        *   If *k* is greater than `list_length`, return an empty list or an error message (depending on the desired behavior).
        *   If *k* is zero or negative, return an empty list.

5.  **Extract the Last k Elements:**
    *   If the input is valid, extract the last *k* elements from the sorted list.  This can be done using slicing (e.g., `list[list_length - k:]` in Python).

6.  **Return the Result:**
    *   Return the extracted list of the last *k* elements.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a new list containing the last *k* elements of the sorted input list.  If *k* is invalid (greater than the list length or non-positive), an empty list or an appropriate error message will be returned.

**Example:**

*   **Input List:** `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9
