Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to sort a list of names alphabetically and then list the sorted names. It's a simple sorting and output process.

**2. Input Data**

*   **Input:** A list of names (strings).  We can assume this list is initially unsorted.
*   **Data Type:**  The names are strings.

**3. Main Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **List of names on record:** The algorithm receives a list of names as input.
3.  **Sort the list and keep the text addresses:** This is the core sorting step.  We'll assume a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort is being used.  The algorithm sorts the list of names alphabetically.  Crucially, it *keeps* the original text addresses associated with each name.  This is important to maintain the original data.
4.  **List:** The algorithm outputs the sorted list of names.
5.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**4. Detailed Breakdown & Assumptions**

*   **Sorting Algorithm:**  The flowchart doesn't specify the sorting algorithm.  We'll assume a basic sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.  These are relatively simple to implement.
*   **Data Structure:** We'll assume the names are stored in a list (or array) where each element is a string representing a name.  We'll also assume each name is associated with a text address (a string).  This could be a dictionary or a similar data structure where the key is the name and the value is the address.
*   **Function Calls (Implicit):**  The "Sort" step likely involves a function call to a sorting function.  This function would take the list of names as input and return a new sorted list.
*   **Loop (Implicit):** The sorting algorithm itself will likely involve a loop to iterate through the list and compare names.

**5. Expected Output**

*   **Output:** A new list of names, sorted alphabetically.  Each name in the output list is associated with its original text address.

**Example:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Names: `["Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"]`
    *   Text Addresses
