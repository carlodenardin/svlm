Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm it represents.

**Overview:**

The flowchart depicts an algorithm designed to find the *last* element in a list of numbers, sorted in descending order.  It's essentially a way to identify the largest element after the list has already been sorted.

**Input Data:**

*   A list of numbers (integers or floats).  This list is assumed to be initially unsorted.

**Algorithm Implementation (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Receive the unsorted list of numbers as input.
    *   Create a copy of the input list. This is important to avoid modifying the original list.

2.  **Sorting (Descending Order):**
    *   Sort the copied list in descending order.  This can be achieved using various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).  The flowchart indicates a sorting step.
    *   The sorting algorithm should arrange the numbers from largest to smallest.

3.  **Finding the Last Element:**
    *   After the list is sorted, the last element in the sorted list is the largest element in the original unsorted list.
    *   Access the last element of the sorted list.

4.  **Output:**
    *   Return the last element of the sorted list.

**Logical Flow (Detailed):**

1.  **Start:** The algorithm begins.
2.  **Input:** The algorithm receives the unsorted list of numbers.
3.  **Copy:** A copy of the input list is created.
4.  **Sort:** The copied list is sorted in descending order.  This is a critical step.
5.  **Access Last Element:** The algorithm accesses the last element of the sorted list.
6.  **Output:** The algorithm returns the value of the last element.
7.  **End:** The algorithm terminates.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`.

1.  The list is copied.
2.  The copied list is sorted in descending order: `[9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]`.
3.  The last element (index 7)
