Okay, let's break down the algorithm described in the flowchart.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to sort a list of integers and return only the last *k* elements of the sorted list.  It's essentially a sub-selection and sorting operation.

**2. Input Data**

*   **List of Integers:** This is the primary input â€“ a collection of integer values.
*   **Variable k:** This integer represents the number of elements to be selected from the end of the sorted list.  It determines the "tail" of the output.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the list of integers and the value of *k*.
2.  **Sort the List:** The first step is to sort the entire list of integers in ascending order.  This can be done using any standard sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort).  The choice of sorting algorithm will impact the algorithm's efficiency.
3.  **Extract the Last k Elements:** After sorting, the algorithm extracts the last *k* elements from the sorted list. This can be achieved by slicing the list.
4.  **Return the Result:** Finally, the algorithm returns the extracted last *k* elements as the output.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a new list containing only the last *k* elements of the sorted original list.  The elements in the returned list will be in ascending order.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6]` and *k* is 3.

1.  The list is sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
2.  The last 3 elements are extracted: `[6, 7, 8]`
3.  The algorithm returns `[6, 7, 8]`.

**Implementation Notes (Software Engineer Perspective)**

*   **Data Structures:**  The input list can be implemented as an array or a dynamic list (e.g., a linked list).
*   **Sorting Algorithm Choice:**  The choice of sorting algorithm should be based
