Okay, let's break down this flowchart and describe the algorithm's implementation.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to return the last *k* elements of a given list of integers, after the list has been sorted in ascending order.  It's essentially a sublist extraction operation with a sorting prerequisite.

**2. Input Data**

*   **List of Integers:** A list (or array) containing integer values.
*   **k:** An integer representing the number of elements to return from the end of the sorted list.  *k* must be a non-negative integer.

**3. Logical Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Receive Input:** The algorithm begins by receiving the list of integers and the value of *k*.
2.  **Sort the List:** The core of the algorithm is to sort the input list in ascending order. This can be achieved using various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort).  The choice of sorting algorithm will impact the algorithm's efficiency.
3.  **Extract the Sublist:** After sorting, the algorithm extracts the last *k* elements from the sorted list. This can be done by slicing the list.
4.  **Return the Sublist:** The extracted sublist (the last *k* elements) is then returned as the output of the algorithm.

**4. Pseudocode (Illustrative)**

```
Algorithm GetLastK(list, k)
  Input: list (list of integers), k (integer)
  Output: sublist (list of integers)

  // Check for invalid input
  if k <= 0 then
    return [] // Return an empty list if k is zero or negative

  // Sort the list in ascending order
  sorted_list = Sort(list)

  // Extract the last k elements
  sublist = GetLastKElements(sorted_list, k)

  return sublist
```

**5. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a new list containing the last *k* elements of the sorted input list.  If *k* is larger than the length of the original list, the algorithm should return the entire sorted list.

**Example:**

*   **Input:** `list = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4, 7,
