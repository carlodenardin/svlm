Okay, let's break down the algorithm described in the flowchart.

**1. Overview**

The algorithm's purpose is to take a list of integers and a number `k` as input, then return a new list containing the last `k` elements of the original list.  Essentially, it's extracting a sublist from the end of the original list.

**2. Input Data**

*   **List of Integers:** This is the primary input. It's assumed to be a collection of integer values.
*   **Integer `k`:** This is a parameter that specifies the number of elements to be extracted from the end of the list.  `k` must be a non-negative integer.

**3. Logical Flow & Implementation**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm's implementation:

1.  **Receive Input:**
    *   The algorithm begins by receiving the list of integers and the integer `k`.

2.  **Sort the List:**
    *   The algorithm sorts the input list of integers in ascending order.  This is a crucial step to ensure that the "last `k` elements" are actually the elements at the end of the sorted list.  Common sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, or merge sort can be used.

3.  **Extract the Last `k` Elements:**
    *   After sorting, the algorithm extracts the last `k` elements from the sorted list.  This can be done using slicing or indexing.  For example, in Python, you might use `sorted_list[-k:]`.

4.  **Return the Result:**
    *   The algorithm returns the newly created list containing the last `k` elements.

**4. Expected Output**

The algorithm will return a new list containing the last `k` elements of the original list, sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**

Let's say the input list is `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]` and `k = 3`.

1.  The list is sorted: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]`
2.  The last `k` elements (3 elements) are extracted: `[8, 9, 4]`
3.  The algorithm returns the list `[8, 9, 4
