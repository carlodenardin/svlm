The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to receive a list of integers and an integer \( k \) as input, sort the list, and return the last \( k \) elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step implementation:

1. **Input Data**: 
   - Receive a list of integers (`lst`).
   - Receive an integer `k` indicating how many elements from the end should be returned.

2. **Main Logical Flow**:
   - **Sorting the List**: Use a sorting function or method (e.g., Python's `sorted()` or built-in sort methods) to arrange the list in ascending order. This ensures that the subsequent selection is based on the sorted sequence.
   - **Return Last k Elements**: After sorting, access the last \( k \) elements of the sorted list directly since they will naturally occupy the highest indices.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - Return the sublist containing the last \( k \) elements of the original list after it has been sorted.

### Pseudocode Implementation:
```plaintext
function getLastKElements(lst, k):
    # Step 1: Sort the list in ascending order
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    
    # Step 2: Return the last k elements
    return sorted_lst[-k:]
```

### Example:
Given a list `[5, 2, 8, 12, 3]` and \( k = 3 \):
1. The list is sorted: `[2, 3, 5, 8, 12]`.
2. The last three elements are selected: `[8, 12, 3]`.

Thus, the output would be `[8, 12, 3]`.
