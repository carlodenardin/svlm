The purpose of the algorithm is to process a list of integers and an integer \( k \), sort the list, and return the last \( k \) elements.

### Input Data:
- A list of integers (\( \text{lst} \))
- An integer \( k \) (the number of elements to return from the end)

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Receive the input**: Start by receiving the list of integers (\( \text{lst} \)) and the integer \( k \) as inputs.
2. **Sort the list**: Sort the given list in ascending or descending order depending on requirements. This can be achieved using built-in sorting functions like `sorted()` in Python.
3. **Return the specified portion**: After sorting, extract the last \( k \) elements from the sorted list.

### Expected Output:
- The output will be a new list containing the last \( k \) elements from the original list after it has been sorted.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Define a function that takes two parameters: the list of integers (\( \text{lst} \)) and the integer \( k \).
2. Inside the function, use the `sorted()` function to sort the list in ascending order if required.
3. Extract the last \( k \) elements from the sorted list using slicing (`lst[-k:]`).
4. Return the resulting sublist which contains the last \( k \) elements.

```python
def get_last_k_elements(lst, k):
    # Step 2: Sort the list
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    # Step 3: Get the last k elements
    return sorted_lst[-k:]
```

This implementation ensures that the list is properly sorted before returning the desired portion at the end.
