The flowchart represents an algorithm for sorting a list of integers. Here is a step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins here.
2. **Input Data**: The input consists of a list of integers (`list[int]`) and a key integer (`kint`).
3. **Sorting**: Use the `sort()` function to sort the list in ascending order.
4. **Index Extraction**: Extract the element at index `[-k]` from the sorted list, where `k` is the given key integer. This value will be used as part of the output.
5. **End**: The process concludes here.

**Expected Output**: The extracted element from the specified index in the sorted list.

This algorithm efficiently retrieves the desired element by leveraging built-in sorting functions commonly available in programming languages like Python or Java.
