The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order and return the last k elements. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step implementation description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the 'Start' node.
2. **Input Data**: An integer array `arr` is required as input data, where each element is an integer (`int`). Additionally, an integer value `k` must be provided which specifies how many elements from the sorted list should be returned.
3. **Sorting Process**: 
   - Implement or use an existing sorting function (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) to sort the entire array `arr` in ascending order. This will ensure that all elements are arranged correctly before identifying the desired subset.
4. **Extract Last K Elements**: 
   - After sorting the array, access the last `k` elements by slicing the sorted array from index `len(arr) - k` to the end. These elements represent the final output needed.
5. **Output**: 
   - Return the extracted subarray containing the last `k` elements. This result fulfills the requirement specified by the user inputs.
6. **End**: The process concludes here with the 'End' node signaling completion.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in handling the task described by the flowchart.
