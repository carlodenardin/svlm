The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to sort a list of integers and retain the last k elements. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the initial node labeled 'Start'.
2. **Input Data**: An input is required, specifically a list of integers along with an integer \( k \) that specifies how many elements from the end of the list should be retained after sorting.
3. **Sorting Process**: 
   - The main task involves sorting the entire list of integers. This can typically be achieved using standard algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.
4. **Retaining Elements**: 
   - After sorting the complete list, identify and keep only the last \( k \) elements. This may involve slicing the sorted list to achieve this.
5. **Output**: 
   - The final output is a new list containing the specified number of elements from the end of the original sorted list.
6. **End**: The process concludes here, as indicated by the 'End' node.

This approach ensures efficient handling of large datasets where retaining specific portions of data based on their position in the sorted order is necessary.
