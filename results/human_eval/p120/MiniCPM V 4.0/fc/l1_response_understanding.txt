The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to sort a list of integers and retain the last k elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step implementation:

### Algorithm Overview:
The purpose of this algorithm is to process a list of integers, identify the number of elements (k), sort the remaining elements after keeping the last k, and produce a new sorted list containing only these retained elements.

### Input Data:
1. **List of Integers**: The initial dataset comprising multiple integer values.
2. **Integer k**: Specifies how many of the original elements should be kept at the end of the output list.

### Main Logical Flow:
1. **Start**: Begin the sorting process.
2. **Input List and k**: Accept the input list and the value of k.
3. **Sorting Process**: 
   - Sort the entire list in ascending order.
4. **Retain Last k Elements**: 
   - Extract the last k elements from the sorted list.
5. **Output Result**: Return the newly formed list with the required length.
6. **End**: Conclude the algorithm execution.

### Expected Output:
- A new list consisting of the last k elements from the originally provided list, now sorted in ascending order.

This structured approach ensures that the specified requirements are met efficiently through clear decision points and iterative processes as depicted in the flowchart.
