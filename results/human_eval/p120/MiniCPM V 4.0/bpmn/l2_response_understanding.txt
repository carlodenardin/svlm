The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to sort a list of integers in ascending order and return the last k elements. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

1. **Start**: Begin with receiving a list of integers and a variable \( k \). This input data is essential for determining which portion of the sorted list will be returned.
2. **Sort the List**: Utilize a sorting algorithm such as quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort to arrange the list of integers in ascending order. Ensure efficient sorting by choosing the appropriate method based on performance requirements.
3. **Return Last k Elements**: Once the list is sorted, extract the last k elements from the sorted array. This can be achieved using slicing notation in many programming languages like Python or JavaScript.
4. **End**: The process concludes here, providing the required output of the last k elements in ascending order.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in implementing the specified functionality.
