The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to process a list of integers and return the last k elements. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Start**: The process begins at the start node.
2. **Receive Input**: The first step involves receiving a list of integers and a variable \( k \). This input data is essential for determining which elements will be returned in the final output.
3. **Sorting**: Next, sort the provided list of integers in ascending order. Sorting ensures that the elements are arranged from smallest to largest.
4. **Extract Last k Elements**: After sorting, extract the last \( k \) elements from the sorted list. These elements represent the desired subset based on the value of \( k \).
5. **End**: Finally, conclude the process by returning the extracted last \( k \) elements as the output.

This algorithm efficiently processes integer lists and filters out specific portions based on user-defined criteria (the number \( k \)).
