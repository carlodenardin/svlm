The flowchart outlines an algorithm designed to receive a list of integers and a variable k, then return the sorted list containing only the last k elements. Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Input Data**: The input consists of a list of integers and an integer variable `k` that specifies how many elements from the end of the list should be included in the output.

2. **Main Logical Flow**:
   - Start by receiving the list of integers and the value of `k`.
   - Sort the entire list in ascending order using any sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
   - Extract the last `k` elements from the sorted list.
   - Return the extracted sublist as the final result.

3. **Expected Output**: The output will be a new list consisting of the last `k` elements from the original list after it has been sorted.

This process ensures that regardless of the initial state of the input list, the function correctly identifies and returns the required subset at the end.
