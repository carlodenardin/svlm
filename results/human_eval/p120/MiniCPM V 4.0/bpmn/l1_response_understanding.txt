The purpose of the algorithm depicted in the flowchart is to sort a list of integers and return only the last k elements from that sorted list.

**Input Data:**
- A list of integer values.
- An integer variable `k` representing the number of elements to keep after sorting.

**Main Logical Flow:**
1. **Start**: Begin with an empty state or initial input data.
2. **Receive Input**: Receive the list of integers and the value of `k` as inputs.
3. **Sorting Process**:
   - Implement a function (e.g., Python's `sorted()`) to sort the list of integers in ascending order.
4. **Select Last k Elements**:
   - Use slicing on the sorted list to select the last `k` elements. This can be done using `[sorted_list[-k:]]`.
5. **Return Output**: 
   - Return the selected sublist containing the last `k` elements.
6. **End**: Conclude the process once all steps are completed.

**Expected Output:**
- The output will be a new list containing only the last `k` elements from the original sorted list of integers.

This step-by-step implementation ensures efficient retrieval of the required portion of the sorted list based on the given parameter `k`.
