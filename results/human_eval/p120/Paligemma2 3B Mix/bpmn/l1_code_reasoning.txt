I’m missing the actual reasoning text and the specific problem you want solved. To translate the exact reasoning into executable Python code (with the requested flowcharts), please provide:

- The exact problem statement (input/output specification).
- The step-by-step reasoning or decision process the small VLM should follow (the algorithm).
- Any constraints or edge cases I should handle.
- Whether ASCII flowcharts are acceptable for both the main algorithm and each function, or if you prefer another format.

Once I have that, I’ll output a Python function (or module) that follows the reasoning precisely and include:
- A flowchart for the main body of the algorithm.
- A separate diagram for each function.
