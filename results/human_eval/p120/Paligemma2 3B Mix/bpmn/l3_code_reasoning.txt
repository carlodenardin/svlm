Iâ€™m missing the actual reasoning steps you want translated into code. Please provide:

- The reasoning snippet (the step-by-step approach the VLM uses), or
- The exact problem statement and any constraints, plus an example of input/output.

Once I have that, I will translate the given reasoning into a faithful Python function exactly as described.
