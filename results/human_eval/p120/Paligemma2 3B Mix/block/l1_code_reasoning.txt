I’m missing the specific reasoning text the VLM is supposed to follow. Please provide:

- The problem statement (if any)
- The exact reasoning steps or the chain-of-thought you want me to translate
- The desired function signature (e.g., def solve():) and input/output format

With those, I’ll generate the exact Python implementation that mirrors the given reasoning.
