Certainly! Here is a clear description of the algorithm represented by the flowchart:

---

### Overview
This algorithm finds the **k largest elements** in a given list of integers. It does so by sorting the list and then selecting the last `k` elements, which are guaranteed to be the largest after sorting.

---

### Input Data
- **A list of integers**, e.g., `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]`
- **An integer `k`**, representing how many of the largest elements to return, e.g., `k = 3`

---

### Main Logical Flow

1. **Receive Inputs**  
   - Accept a list of integers and an integer `k`.

2. **Sort the List**  
   - Apply a sorting algorithm (e.g., built-in `sort()` function) to arrange the integers in **ascending order**.

3. **Select Last k Elements**  
   - Extract the last `k` elements from the sorted list (as these are the largest).

---

### Expected Output
- A **list containing the `k` largest integers** from the input list, in ascending order.

---

### Example

#### Input
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
k = 3
```

#### Output
```python
[4, 5, 9]
```

---

### Implementation (Python Example)

```python
def k_largest_elements(numbers, k):
    numbers.sort()
    return numbers[-k:]
```

---

**Summary:**  
This algorithm sorts the input list and returns the largest `k` items. It is simple, effective for small to medium input sizes, and ensures the output is sorted.
