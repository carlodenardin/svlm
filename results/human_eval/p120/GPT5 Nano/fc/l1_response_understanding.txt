### **Algorithm Overview**
**Purpose:**  
To find the largest `k` elements in a given list of integers.

---

### **Input Data**
- **A list of integers** (e.g., `[10, 4, 23, 7, 89]`)
- **An integer `k`** (e.g., `3`), representing how many of the largest elements to retain

---

### **Main Logic Flow**
1. **Receive Input:**  
   Accept a list of integers and the integer `k`.

2. **Sort the List:**  
   Sort the input list in ascending order (smallest to largest).

3. **Select Last `k` Elements:**  
   After sorting, extract the last `k` elements from the sorted list (since these will be the largest).

4. **Return the Result:**  
   Output the list of the largest `k` elements.

---

### **Expected Output**
- **A list of the `k` largest integers** from the input list, sorted in ascending order.

### **Step-by-Step Process for Implementation**

#### **Example Implementation (in Python)**
```python
def get_k_largest_elements(integer_list, k):
    # Step 1: Sort the list in ascending order
    sorted_list = sorted(integer_list)
    
    # Step 2: Get the last k elements from the sorted list
    largest_k_elements = sorted_list[-k:]
    
    # Step 3: Return the result
    return largest_k_elements

# Example use:
input_list = [10, 4, 23, 7, 89]
k = 3
result = get_k_largest_elements(input_list, k)
print(result)  # Output: [10, 23, 89]
```

---

**Note:**  
- If `k` is greater than the length of the list, return the entire sorted list.
- This implementation assumes `k` is a non-negative integer.

This process is ready to be implemented in any programming language, adapting the steps as required by language syntax.
